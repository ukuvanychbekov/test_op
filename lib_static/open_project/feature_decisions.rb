module OpenProject
  ##
  # This module is the container for temporary or permanent feature flags.
  #
  # New feature flags can automatically be added by calling
  #
  #   OpenProject::Application.initializer 'set flag' do
  #     OpenProject::FeatureDecisions.add :the_name_of_the_flag
  #   end
  #
  # This will set up:
  # * the method `.the_name_of_the_flag_active?` for querying the state
  #   of the flag. By default, it is false.
  # * fetching the overwritten value from
  #   * ENV variable (`OPENPROJECT_FEATURE_THE_NAME_OF_THE_FLAG_ACTIVE = 'true'`)
  #   * configuration.yml file (`the_name_of_the_flag_active: true`)
  #   * from the settings database table (`Setting.feature_the_name_of_the_flag_active = true)
  # * including the flag in the `.active` array in case it is enabled
  # * including the flag in the `.all`
  #
  # The setup should be carried out inside an initializer for the overwriting from ENV or configuration.yml
  # to be picked up.
  #
  # A spec in which such a flag is to be enabled can do so via:
  #
  #   context 'some description', with_flag: { the_name_of_the_flag: true } do
  #     ...
  #   end
  #
