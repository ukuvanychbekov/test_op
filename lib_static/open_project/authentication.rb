        #     :|--------------------|>-------------------|>----------------|:
        #           Password Auth      Extra Stage (2FA)    Complete Login

        # Only in the final complete login stage will the user's session be reset and
        # the current_user set to the successfully authenticated user. Until then the
        # initially authenticated user will be stored in the intermediate session
        # as `authenticated_user_id`.
        #
        # Any stage has to be completed by redirecting back to `Stage.complete_path`.
        # If the stage fails it may handle displaying the failure itself. If not it can
        # redirect to `Stage.failure_path` to show a generic failure page which will show
        # any flash errors.

        # @param path [String] Path to redirect to for the stage to start.

        #                                       a user was registered and activated. This only
        #                                       makes sense if the extra stage is possible at

        # @param active [Block] A block returning true (default) if this stage is active.
        # @param before [Symbol] Identifier before which to insert this stage. Stage will be

        #                        Cannot be used with `after`.
