# OpenProject Glossary

![Glossary of OpenProject](glossary-openproject-header.png)

Project management is a complex process. At the same time, when it comes to software, there are many technical words involved. When these two things come together, it creates an interesting tool that introduces a completely new way of doing things. This new way of doing things has its own set of terms and concepts. In this glossary, you will find the most commonly used terms in OpenProject Software. Each term is defined briefly and supplemented with links to get more information if needed.

## A

### Admin

In OpenProject, the person who has administrative rights in an instance is called **system admin**. All information concerning the configuration of an OpenProject instance are documented in the [System admin guide](https://www.openproject.org/docs/system-admin-guide/#system-admin-guide). Please note that an 'admin' can also describe the role of a person inside a project. This person would be called **project admin** and usually has specific rights on a project level. A project admin does not necessarily have system admin rights.

### Agile project management

Agile project management is an iterative and flexible approach to managing projects. It focuses on collaboration, adaptability, and self-organizing teams. OpenProject supports agile project management as well as [classic project management](#classic-project-management), and works best for [hybrid project management](#hybrid-project-management).

### Authentication

In OpenProject, authentication is an important element to guarantee a data protected usage. To adapt these authentication settings, you need to have [admin](#admin) rights. Navigate to your username and select -> Administration -> Authentication. At OpenProject, we use [OAuth 2.0](#oauth) as this is the definitive industry standard for online authorization.
