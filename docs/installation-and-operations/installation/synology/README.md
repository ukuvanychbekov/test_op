# Synology

Synology offers NAS devices that come with a UI for starting docker containers on them.
This means OpenProject has to be used exactly as described in the [docker](../docker/#one-container-per-process-recommended) section.

## Launching the container

Launching OpenProject works like launching any other container in [Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/help/Docker/docker_container).

First you have to go to the **Registry** section and download the OpenProject image.
It's best to choose the specific tag of the latest stable version (`openproject/community:11` at the time of writing).
You can use `:latest` too but it might lead to surprises when a major version upgrade happens.

Below are some settings you have to pay attention to when launching the container.

**Volumes**

Most importantly you **have to configure mounted volumes** for `pgdata` and `assets` as described in that section.
When launching the container you can configure this under the advanced settings in the volumes tab.
Otherwise you will lose your data when the container is deleted during an update.

**Ports**

You should also configure a specific port in the network tab so that your container will always run
on the same port. Otherwise it might happen that the port changes when the container restarts.

**Restart policy**

You should also check the "always restart" option when launching the container.

## Updates

For updates to be safe make sure that you have mounted the `pgdata` and `assets` folders as volumes.
Ideally you should also always backup these folders before any updates.

Updating the container then works like this:

1. Go to the **Registry**
2. Search for OpenProject, click download and choose the tag you want to update (e.g. 11 or latest).
3. Stop the container once the new image has been downloaded.
4. Click on clear and restart the container.

This will restart the container with the updated image.
Your OpenProject data will remain intact as long as you mounted the volumes as described above.

## FAQ

### I had already started OpenProject without mounted volumes. How do I save my data during an update?

You will need to open a terminal on your Synology disk station.
Then follow the instructions given in the [upgrade section](../../operation/upgrading/#i-have-already-started-openproject-without-mounted-volumes-how-do-i-save-my-data-during-an-update).
