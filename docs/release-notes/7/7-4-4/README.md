# OpenProject 7.4.4

Version 7.4.4 of OpenProject has been released. This release contains the
following bug
    fixes:

  - Work package modification for regular users on MySQL-based
    instances ([#27237](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27237))
  - Child work packages were not deleted when the parent element is
    deleted ([#27280](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27280))
  - The fuzzy project autocompletion has been corrected to provide
    better matching when a substring is matched
    ([#27447](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27447))
  - The GitHub integration plugin did not properly receive events due to
    a naming clash
    ([#27448](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27448))
  - Creating new wiki pages from a wiki link (e.g,  *\[\[
    Wiki
    page \]\] *) now retains the correct title instead of the generated
    URL slug ([#27462](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27462))
  - A subsequent search for documents in the global search disabled the
    documents search checkbox
    ([#27479](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27479))
  - The reset button for RSS tokens generated a new API token instead
    ([#27498](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27498))
  - Wiki
    start pages
    (titled *Wiki*)
    could not be renamed back if the name was changed at one point
    ([#27576](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27576))

 

### Changes

  - Meetings
    plugin: The *close* button of the show page now requires a
    confirmation before closing
    ([#27336](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27336))
  - The restriction to create a time entry with at maximum 1000 hours on
    a single work package has been lifted
    ([#27457](https://community.openproject.com/wp/27457))
