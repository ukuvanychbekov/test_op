# OpenProject 7.0

OpenProject 7.0 is the biggest OpenProject release yet with amazing new
features: A new interactive timeline, hierarchies in the work package
table, multi-select custom fields and much more.

## New integrated Gantt chart / timeline

OpenProject 7.0 introduces a new Gantt chart which is integrated in the
work package table ([#13785](https://community.openproject.com/wp/13785)).

The new timeline is much more interactive and user-friendly than the old
timeline.



## Display hierarchies in work package table

You can display hierarchies on the work package table and collapse and
expand them
([#24647](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24647)).



## Attribute group configuration for work package types

With OpenProject 7.0 you can configure which attributes
are displayed for a work package type
([#24123](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24123)).

You can therefore control which attributes are shown and which are
hidden by default.



## Filter based on date in work package table

The work package table now supports filtering based on fixed dates. This
affects all date attributes (e.g. start / due date, created on / updated
on)
([#22585](https://community.openproject.com/projects/telekom/work_packages/22585)).



## New header navigation

The header navigation in OpenProject is updated and displays the current
project. Additionally, the logo has been centered and existing menus
have been reordered
([#24465](https://community.openproject.com/projects/design/work_packages/24465)).



## Archive and delete projects from project settings

As an administrator you can archive and delete projects right from the
project settings
([#24913](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24913)).



## Zen-mode on work package page

With the zen mode on the work package table, you can maximize the
available screen real estate by hiding the side and top navigation
([#18216](https://community.openproject.com/wp/18216)).

This provides a cleaner and larger user interface to work with.



## Multi-select custom fields (Enterprise add-on)

Users of the OpenProject [Enterprise on-premises](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/) 
and [Enterprise cloud](https://www.openproject.org/hosting/) can create multi-select
custom fields
([#24793](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24793)).

With these custom fields you can select multiple values for work package
custom fields at once and also filter based on them.



## Logo upload and custom color scheme (Enterprise add-on)

Users of the OpenProject Enterprise cloud and Enterprise on-premises edition can upload
their own company’s logo instead of the OpenProject logo.

Additionally, you can change the colors by using a custom color scheme
([#18099](https://community.openproject.com/projects/gmbh/work_packages/18099),
[#24460](https://community.openproject.com/projects/gmbh/work_packages/24460)).



## Performance improvements

The performance – especially for the work package table – has been improved. Loading and displaying work packages is faster.

## Improved design

OpenProject 7.0 includes several design improvements and improves the
user experience for users accessing OpenProject on a mobile device.

## Substantial number of bug fixes

OpenProject 7.0 contains a large number of bugs fixes.
