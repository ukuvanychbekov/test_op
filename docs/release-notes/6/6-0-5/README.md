      - The grouping of work packages was lost on export.
      - In work package custom fields the zero was displayed as not set

        ([#24033](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24033)).
      - Curly braces in the work package description (e.g. to show code)
        were incorrectly displayed / escaped
        ([#24050](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24050)).

        the work package table
