# OpenProject 6.1.1

OpenProject 6.1.1 contains several bug fixes and improvements.

**The following bugs have been fixed in OpenProject 6.1.1:**

  - Work packages
      - Watchers could not be selected in projects with too many
        possible watchers
        ([#24263](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24263)).
      - The wrong sum was shown for “Spent time” for work packages
        ([#24349](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24349)).
      - The links in the relation tab caused a hard reload instead of
        simply showing the related work package
        ([#24265](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24265)).
      - Textile \<pre\> and @ did not prevent code execution in the work
        package description.
      - The “Spent time” link on the work package table caused an error
        404 in subfolder installations
        ([#24427](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24427)).
      - Line breaks were not displayed in the work package description
        ([#24428](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24428)).
  - Timeline
      - Timelines which were displayed in aggregation were not shown
        when loaded initially.
  - Projects
      - Projects could not be copied
        ([#24323](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24323)).
  - Search
      - The search displayed only case-sensitive results
        ([#24282](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24282)).
      - The pagination in the search results was broken
        ([#24345](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24345)).
  - Other
      - A deprecation warning was displayed whenever a cronjob for
        incoming emails was invoked
        ([#24306](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24306)).
      - Several design bugs have been fixed
        ([#24263](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24263),
        [#24274](https://community.openproject.com/wp/24274),
