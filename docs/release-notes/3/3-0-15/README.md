# OpenProject 3.0.15

The newest patch release for OpenProject (3.0.15) has been released and
contains several security and bug fixes.  
We advise everyone to update their version of OpenProject.

In addition to updating the rails version to 3.2.20, security fixes
regarding sprockets are introduced with 3.0.15.  
Furthermore, a bug which prevented the timelines macro from working
properly has been fixed
([#17010](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17010 "Timeline controls separate from rest of timeline when timeline embedded in wiki page (closed)")).

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the 
[OpenProject 3.0.15 query](https://community.openproject.org/versions/503).
