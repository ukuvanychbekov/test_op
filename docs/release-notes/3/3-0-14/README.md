# OpenProject 3.0.14

The release of 3.0.14 of OpenProject contains several bug fixes.  
We advise everybody to update their OpenProject installation.

Most notably, copying projects works properly again. In the previous
version it was not possible to properly copy projects either from the
admin or project settings. This has been fixed with version 3.0.14
([#15706](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/15706 "[Copy project] Projects cannot be copied (formerly: Subprojects are not copied correctly and the ... (closed)")).

Additionally, an error in the repository caused content of files to be
displayed twice
([#16169](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/16169 "Viewing content in repository or attachments shows up twice (closed)")).
This has been reported and fixed by [Bj√∂rn Blissing](https://github.com/bjornblissing). Many thanks!
