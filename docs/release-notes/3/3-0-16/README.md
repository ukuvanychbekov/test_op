# OpenProject 3.0.16

A new patch release for OpenProject 3 (3.0.16) has been released which
contains several security updates and bug fixes.  
We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations.

With OpenProject 3.0.16, the Rails version has been updated to 3.2.21
([#17468](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17468 "Updating Rails to 3.2.21 (closed)")).  
In addition, an older version of Net-LDAP has been upgraded which caused
problems in combination with Apache DS
([#17498](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17498 "Upgrade version of \"Net-LDAP\" (fixes problems with Apache DS) (closed)")).

In the previous OpenProject version the permission for “Spent time” was
not applied properly. This has been fixed with OpenProject 3.0.16
([#17496](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17496 "Permission for 'spent time' not applied on legacy WP view and list of time entries (closed)")).

A big thanks goes to everyone involved in fixing and reporting those
bugs!
