# OpenProject 12.5.0

Release date: 2023-03-20

We have released [OpenProject 12.5.0](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1611).

This new release is again packed with many new collaboration features, improvements and bug fixes.
Version 12.5 brings the anticipated collaboration features for the **Nextcloud integration to the OpenProject side**. Nextcloud and OpenProject now offer users of both services a way to manage their projects and share files seamlessly and without disruption.

OpenProject 12.5 now also lets system administrator **define additional non-working days** on an instance level, such as public holidays. We are also happy to **release another Enterprise add-on** to the free-of-charge Community version: The advanced search functionality not only supports full text search but also enables users to search for work package attachments or content. 

## Upload files to Nextcloud while working in OpenProject

OpenProject 12.5 launches the next step for the integration between OpenProject and Nextcloud. It is now possible to upload new files to Nextcloud and link them directly to a work package all from within OpenProject. The close connection of work packages with project-related files combines the advantages of both open source systems.

Different use cases are covered for uploading and linking files directly from within a work package.

### Link an existing Nextcloud file or folder to an OpenProject work package

If you want to link an existing project related file or folder from Nextcloud to an OpenProject work package, you can now do it directly within the work package in OpenProject.

To do so, start by clicking on **Link existing files** underneath the section of your Nextcloud file storage.

![openproject-nextcloud-files-link](openproject-nextcloud-files-link.png)

### A new file picker in OpenProject

A new file picker will appear, displaying all the files and folders on your Nextcloud instance that you have permission to see.

![openproject-nextcloud-files-picker](openproject-nextcloud-files-picker.png)

To link a certain file or folder with this work package, click on the checkbox to the left of each item. Once you have selected the relevant file(s) or folder(s), click on the **Link files** button. The number on the button will represent the number of files/folders you have selected.

### Upload a new file to Nextcloud directly from OpenProject

It is now possible to upload a new file from your device directly to Nextcloud from within an OpenProject work package.

Click on the **Upload files** link. You will be prompted to select a file (or multiple files) on your computer that you want to upload to Nextcloud and link the the current work package, in one action.

Alternatively, you can also simply drag a file or folder on your computer to this area (under the name of your Nextcloud file storage) and drop it in the drop zone that appears.

Once you have selected or dropped the files you would like to upload, simply select a folder on Nextcloud in which they should be stored and click the **Choose location** button.

### Upload files during when creating new work package

The ability to upload new files to Nextcloud directly from OpenProject or link existing files to work packages is not reserved only for existing work packages. You can now do both also when creating a new work package.



![openproject-nextcloud-upload-files-empty-status](openproject-nextcloud-upload-files-empty-status.png)

### More options for linked Nextcloud files in OpenProject

The **Files** tab shows you Nextcloud files that are linked to the current work package. Hovering on any linked file with your mouse will give you options to open or download the file, show the containing folder in Nextcloud or remove the link.

**Please note:** Removing the link from within a work package in OpenProject will not delete the file or folder in Nextcloud. When uploading a new file with the same name, you will be asked if you want to either overwrite the existing one in Nextcloud or create an additional copy of it.

## Setting public holidays as non-working days

OpenProject already lets administrators set the work week at an instance-level by letting them define the working and non-working days of the week.

With OpenProject 12.5, administrators can now also define additional individual non-working days of the year. This can be useful to program in public holidays or closures. Work packages cannot then start or end on these days and these days do not count towards the duration of a work package. (A user can nevertheless turn the 'Working days only' switch off at a work package level and schedule on non-working days if needed).

![Non-working-days-holidays](Non-working-days-holidays.png)

**Please note**: These additional non-working days are set at an instance level and affect all work packages in all projects. Adding additional non-working days can therefore affect and reschedule a large number of work packages in the instance (except those for which the 'Working days only' switch is turned off). Individual non-working days and are also tied to a specific year. Recurring holidays like Christmas have to be set separately for each year. 

## View project activity

Starting with OpenProject 12.5, the Activities module (if enabled) will now include the changes to project attributes and project custom fields. You can directly open the project activity view from the Project list by clicking on the *More* menu of a particular project and then choosing *Project activity*.

![project-list-activity](project-list-activity.png)

You can also access project activity by clicking on *Activity* on the project sidebar menu and using the filters at the bottom of the sidebar to filter for the attributes you wish to view.

![project-activity-tracking](project-activity-tracking.png)

## New default filter for overdue work packages

We have added a new default filter **Overdue**  to the work package module so that you can quickly see which of your work packages are overdue and need attention.

![work-package-filter-overdue](work-package-filter-overdue.png)

## Printing Wikis

If you want to print your Wiki, with OpenProject 12.5 you can now do so. A print function has been added to the **More** menu at the top right corner of your Wiki.

## Advanced search for work package attachment or content released to the community

With OpenProject 12.5, we are happy to announce that another Enterprise add-on was released to the free-of-charge Community version. The advanced filters enable not only full text search but also to [filter and search for work packages attachments and content of the attachments](../../../user-guide/work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/#filter-for-attachment-file-name-and-content).

![openproject-search-work-package-attachments](openproject-search-work-package-attachments.png)
