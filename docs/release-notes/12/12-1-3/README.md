# OpenProject 12.1.3

Release date: 2022-05-12

We released [OpenProject 12.1.3](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1550).
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

## Settings regression

OpenProject introduced a larger refactoring of the app settings to clean up
the distinction between ENV settings and database-based settings.

Unfortunately, that introduced some constraints that caused the following bugs in downstream products,
warranting another patch level release. We're sorry for the inconvenience caused.

If you experience bugs in installing or using OpenProject, please help us by reporting them to our community.
