Release date: 2022-03-16

We released [OpenProject 12.0.10](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1512).
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

##### Localization issues

Some translations provided by our Crowdin integration were temporarily reverted to their english originals.
