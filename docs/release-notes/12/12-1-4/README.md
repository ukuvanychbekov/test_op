# OpenProject 12.1.4

Release date: 2022-05-17

We released [OpenProject 12.1.4](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1551).
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

**Centos 7 support**
This version restores support for OpenProject packages on centos 7. A PostgreSQL bump has caused incompatibility issues with the centos7 versions that are shipped and extra effort was needed to provide compatible newer dev headers.
