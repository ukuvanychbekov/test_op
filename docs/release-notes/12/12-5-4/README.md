# OpenProject 12.5.4

Release date: 2023-05-02

We released [OpenProject 12.5.4](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1728).
The release contains two security related bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.



### CVE-2023-31140: Invalidation of existing sessions when 2FA activated \[[#48035](https://community.openproject.com/wp/48035)\]

When a user registers and confirms their first two-factor authentication (2FA) device for an account, existing logged in sessions for that user account are not terminated. Likewise, if an administrators creates a mobile phone 2FA device on behalf of a user, their existing sessions are not terminated. The issue has been resolved in OpenProject version 12.5.4 by actively terminating sessions of user accounts having registered and confirmed a 2FA device.

If you have a security vulnerability you would like to disclose, please see our [statement on security](https://www.openproject.org/docs/security-and-privacy/statement-on-security/).

For more information, [please see our security advisory](https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-xfp9-qqfj-x28q).

**Workarounds**

As a workaround, users who register the first 2FA device on their account can manually log out to terminate all other active sessions. This is the default behavior of OpenProject but might be disabled [through a configuration option](https://www.openproject.org/docs/installation-and-operations/configuration/#setting-session-options). Double check that this option is not overridden if you plan to employ the workaround.

### Invalidation of password reset link when user changes password in the meantime \[[#48036](https://community.openproject.com/wp/48036)\]

When a user requests a password reset, an email is sent with a link to confirm and reset the password. If the user changes the password in an active session in the meantime, the password reset link was not invalidated and continued to be usable for the duration of its validity period.

The issue has been resolved in OpenProject version 12.5.4 by actively revoking any active password reset tokens for user accounts having changed their passwords successfully within the application.
