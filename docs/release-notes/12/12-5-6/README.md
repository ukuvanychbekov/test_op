# OpenProject 12.5.6

Release date: 2023-06-01

We released [OpenProject 12.5.6](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1794).
The release contains a security related bug fix and we recommend updating to the newest version.

### CVE-2023-31140: Project identifier information leakage through robots.txt

For any OpenProject installation, a robots.txt file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Even if the entire instance is marked as "Login required" and prevents all truly anonymous access, the /robots.txt route remains publicly available.

This results in the URL part of the project (i.e., the project identifier) to be publicly visible. As these identifiers are derived from the project name, they may contain sensitive information.

For more information, [please see our security advisory](https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-xjfc-fqm3-95q8).

**Patches**

You can download the following patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version > 10.0: https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/opf/openproject/pull/12708.patch

**Workaround**
If you are unable to update or apply the provided patch, mark any public project as non-public for the time being and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.
