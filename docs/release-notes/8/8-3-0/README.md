# OpenProject 8.3.0

We released
[OpenProject 8.3.0](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1319).  
The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the
newest version.

#### Notable changes

 

**Modernized My page grid implementation**

OpenProject 8.3. introduces a grid-style dashboard that is now being
rolled out to
the *My page*. Additional pages will be converted to this grid in
the future, and additional common widgets will be
created.

**Improved search functionality**

The global search functionality of OpenProject has been extended to
auto-suggest work package results and provides improved action buttons
to search globally or in the current project.

**Autocompletion of work package attributes**

List-style attributes of work packages (including custom field lists)
have been modified to provide a filterable
autocompleter.

**Improved error reporting for work package bulk editing**

When bulk editing work packages (multiple selected work packages in the
table \> right click and select bulk edit), erroneous work packages were
only reported by their ID. OpenProject 8.3 prints all errors on the bulk
edit page to correct them on the spot.

**Packaged installation uses PostgreSQL**

The packaged installation of OpenProject now suggests to install
PostgreSQL instead of MySQL. For users with previous installations,
nothing will change and their installed MySQL version will be kept. New
users are suggested to use either the autoinstall method of PostgreSQL,
or provide a database connection manually using the database URL. [See
the FAQ for more
information](https://www.openproject.org/download-and-installation/).

**OAuth2 API implementation**

The OpenProject APIv3 can now be authenticated using the OAuth2
standard. To register an OAuth applications, visit the new module under
Administration \> OAuth applications.
