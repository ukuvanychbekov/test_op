# OpenProject 8.2

OpenProject 8.2 includes several improvements, such as a modernized
calendar as well as many usability improvements.

Users of the [Enterprise cloud](https://www.openproject.org/hosting/) and
[Enterprise on-premises](https://www.openproject.org/enterprise-edition/)
can change work packages to a read-only mode to avoid unwanted changes.
Additionally, embedded work package now also support relations.

## Modernized calendar view

The existing calendar view has been replaced with a new, modern calendar
view with OpenProject 8.2. This affects all existing calendar views
(e.g. in a project, on the My page).

## Usability improvements

OpenProject 8.2 includes many usability improvements which make
OpenProject easier and smoother to use. Some examples of usability
improvements include:

  - Create a version from the roadmap and backlog page.
  - Change a work package parent directly from the breadcrumb.
  - A “Related to” relation is created automatically when copying a work
    package.
  - The OpenProject search searches the current project and subprojects
    by default.

## Read-only mode for work packages (Enterprise add-on)

Users of the OpenProject Enterprise cloud and Enterprise on-premises edition can define read-only
work package statuses. When you change a work package’s status to a
read-only status, the work package can no longer be modified. This
allows you to avoid users to e.g. make changes to a work package once it
has been approved.

## Embedded work packages with other relation types (Enterprise add-on)

With OpenProject 8.2 the embed work package capability introduced with
OpenProject 8 is extended to be used with other relation types besides
hierarchical relationships.
