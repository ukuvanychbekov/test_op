# OpenProject 11.1.0

Release date: 2020-12-17

We released [OpenProject 11.1.0](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1424).
This new release will bring many new features and bug fixes that will improve classical as well as agile project management. 

## Improved styling of the WYSIWYG text editor

The styling of texts, headlines, tables, the layout of the table of  contents, and much more have been improved in the WYSIWYG text editor.  This applies not only to wiki pages but also for other text fields, e.g. the description of work packages. To achieve these improvements, we  have, among other things, updated the [CK Editor 5](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/) to version 23.0.0.

## Direct display of user name for @notifications

While editing a work package comment and @-notify someone, the user  name will now directly be displayed even in the edit mode. This way,  it’s much more convenient to notify the correct team member.

## Display project milestones aggregated for projects in a single row in Gantt chart

With OpenProject 11.1 users are now able to **aggregate milestones for projects in the Gantt chart in one single row**. When grouped by projects, the rows can be collapsed with the collapse  all button and the project milestones are still visible in one row. This way, you easily get a high level overview of all important due dates in a project.

## Collapse all button for groups in the work packages list

In the work package table it is possible to group by any attribute,  e.g. assignee, status, priority or type. Now, once grouped by an  attribute, you will have a **collapse all button on top of the work packages list** to close and open all attributes within a group at once.

## Signing Data Processing Agreement (DPA) documents in Enterprise cloud

For EU customers it is required by the GDPR to sign a data processing agreement (sometimes called data processing addendum) before using our Enterprise cloud edition. Until now, we processed these contracts manually. Users had to print the document, enter their information and send it to us. We then had to sign it too, and send it back to the customer.

Luckily, we now automated this process in order to reduce manual effort on both sides. This way, it is even easier to comply with GDPR. Within -> Administration -> GDPR you can now online review and sign your DPA document with us.

## Various improvements and bug fixes

Furthermore, we have extended the authentication profile with an **OpenID Connect provider.** Also, the printing, e.g. for wiki pages, has been optimized via the browser print function.

## As always,…… there’s much more!

There are a lot more things we packed into 11.1 to tell you about.
