# OpenProject 13.0.0

Release date: 2023-08-21

We have released [OpenProject 13.0.0](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1656).

This version comes with a large number of new features, collaboration enhancements, and bug fixes. Among the highly anticipated project management features is the introduction of Baseline comparison. Nextcloud project folders will come with automatically managed permissions and the ability to set up project templates with a pre-defined folder structure and file templates linked to work packages. Subscribe to your OpenProject calendar, and generate work plans via the new PDF export.

Finally, as part of our commitment to the Community, we are pleased to announce that multi-select custom fields are now accessible in the free-of-charge Community version.

The release contains many more features, improvements, and bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

## Baseline comparison to track changes for your project (Enterprise add-on)

With the new Baseline comparison, you can get a quick overview of what has changed in your project over a specific time period. When you enable Baseline for a work package table, all changes for that view are displayed compared to a time period, a specific date, or within a specific time frame.  The changes are highlighted and you can see which work packages have been updated, added or removed in that view. This way you can easily report on the project progress and status.

The functionality **Show changes since Yesterday** is part of the free of charge Community version.

**Comparing changes to a certain period, a specific date, or between two specific dates**, is an Enterprise add-on and only available for the Enterprise cloud or on-premises versions.

## Nextcloud project folders with automatically managed permissions

With OpenProject 13.0 the Nexcloud integration has been enhanced with project folders. A new project folder is now set up in Nextcloud for a project, named after the project in OpenProject and automatically granting access to all project members.
Project folders allow setting up project templates with a pre-defined folder structure, including document templates. Links to files in work packages are copied and updated accordingly.

## PDF Export to create up-to-date and accurately formatted work plans

The PDF export has been updated to significantly improve the quality of project reports that can be created in OpenProject. With 13.0 you will be able to create clearly structured and beautifully designed work plans based on your work packages. The report is based on a work package table, which you can customize to fit your project needs, and includes a header table with work package attributes (defined by the work package table filters) and their detailed description. The new reports also contain a cover page and a table of contents with links back to the work packages in OpenProject.

## Subscribe to calendars via URL (iCalendar format)

You can now have all your OpenProject calendars with all important work packages and milestones integrated in your personal calendar. Subscribe to a calendar via URL and include this information in your personal calendar supporting the iCalendar format, such as such as Thunderbird,  Open-Xchange, Apple calendar or Google calendar.

## Global modules are listed on new index pages

With 13.0 we have added a new global menu to access all global modules for your projects. This provides a useful and intuitive overview of project information (e.g. for work packages, boards, team planners, or meetings) on a project-overarching level. You can create new elements for these respective modules directly from these global pages and assign them to a project.

![Openproject global modules overview](openproject-global-modules.png)

## Time tracking button 
We added a button that allows you to easily record the time spent on a work package. Pressing the button on the work package will start the timer. Your avatar in the header navigation will show the active time tracking. Clicking the button again will stop the time tracking and you can log the time spent on the work package.

## Multi-select custom fields for the Community

We are happy to announce that we have released the multi-select custom fields for the Community. Users of the free-of-charge Community version will now also be able to  configure multi-select custom fields for work packages or projects and add  them to the work packages forms.
