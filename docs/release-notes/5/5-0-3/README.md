# OpenProject 5.0.3

OpenProject 5.0.3 contains a bug fix for creating versions:

  - It was not possible to create a version in the project settings if
    there were no other version in a project
    ([#22094](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22094)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the  
[Changelog v.5.0.3](https://community.openproject.org/versions/782) 
or take a look at
