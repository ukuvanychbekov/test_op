# OpenProject 5.0.15

OpenProject 5.0.15 contains several bug fixes:

  - The date on the project activity was based on UTC+0 and therefore
    showed the wrong date when being in a different time zone
    ([#22641](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22641)).
  - When selecting a query and updating several work packages at once
    using bulk edit, the focus was lost to the work package page. It now
    remains on the query
    ([#22330](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22330)).
  - Due to an error the search text for queries in the dark theme was
    not visible. This has been fixed
    ([#22654](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22654)).
  - Several design improvements have been
    made ([#21338](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21338),
    [#21794](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21794)).

In addition, the accessibility has been improved
([#21910](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21910),
[#22005](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22005)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the  
[Changelog v.5.0.15](https://community.openproject.org/versions/783)
