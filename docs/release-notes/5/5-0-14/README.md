# OpenProject 5.0.14

OpenProject 5.0.14 contains several bug fixes:

  - User avatars were not displayed unless a specific admin setting was
    selected. This has been adjusted
    ([#22595](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22595)).
  - Deleting a work package via bulk action was not possible when time
    was logged on a work package. This has been fixed
    ([#22485](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22485)).
  - An error in the incoming emails functionality has been resolved
    ([#22607](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22607)).
  - Several design errors have been fixed
    ([#20714](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20714),
    [#22497](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22497),
