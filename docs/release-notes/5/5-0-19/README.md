# OpenProject 5.0.19

OpenProject 5.0.19 contains several bug fixes:

  - An error has been resolved which prevented the assignment of work
    packages to groups when editing a work package
    ([#23099](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23099)).
  - An error in the calculation of the progress of work packages with
    children has been fixed
    ([#23251](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23251)).
  - The burndown chart on the backlogs page was broken when a language
    other than English was selected. This has been fixed
    ([#23253](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23253)).
  - The context menu on the backlogs page did not disappear when an
    entry was selected. This has been resolved
    ([#22837](https://community.openproject.com/wp/22837)).
  - It was not possible to delete files attached to a budget. This has
    been fixed
    ([#23110](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23110)).
  - When creating or editing budgets and assigning groups for the
    planned labor costs, “Deleted user” was shown instead of the group
    name. This has been resolved
    ([#23057](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23057)).
  - A security error has been fixed which allowed Angular injections in
    texts
    ([#23073](https://community.openproject.com/wp/23073)).
