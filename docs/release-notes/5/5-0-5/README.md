# OpenProject 5.0.5

OpenProject 5.0.5 contains several bug fixes:

  - An error which prevented a user from adding or removing watchers to
    a work package has been fixed
    ([#22215](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22215)).
  - The watch button on wiki pages, forums and news pages has been fixed
    ([#22086](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22086)).
  - The progress bars (e.g. in roadmap, budgets) are displayed properly
    again
    ([#22225](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22225)).
  - The “watch all” / “hide empty” button on the work package page has
    been renamed to be more descriptive
    ([#22221](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22221)).
  - Several design bugs have been fixed
    ([#22209](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22209),
    [#22200](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22200)).
  - The accessibility has been improved in several places.

Additionally, OpenProject 5.0.5 includes a performance improvement for
the work package full screen view
([#21750](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21750)).
