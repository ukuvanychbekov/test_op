# OpenProject 5.0.9

OpenProject 5.0.9 contains several bug fixes:

  - An error prevented work packages from sometimes being updated when
    edited and edited the previously updated work package instead
    ([#22363](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22363),
    [#22451](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22451)).
  - On mobile devices and on Safari desktop work packages could not be
    opened
    ([#22378](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22378)).
  - On several pages headers were not escaped and HTML was shown
    ([#22453](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22453),
    [#22454](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22454)).
  - Several design errors have been fixed
    ([#21858](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21858),
    [#21869](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21869),
    [#22397](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/22397)).
