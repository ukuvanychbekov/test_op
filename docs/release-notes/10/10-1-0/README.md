# OpenProject 10.1.0

One of the big improvements of the new release of OpenProject 10.1 is the project overview dashboard page with a new project status widget for online project status reporting.

Furthermore, we have included a lot of bug fixes and code maintenance to improve the overall condition of OpenProject.

Read below to get a detailed overview of what is new in OpenProject 10.1.

## Project status reporting

A new **project status widget** can be added to the project overview page for easy and transparent project status reporting. It displays the project status in a traffic light.

Communicate the project status to your team and stakeholders in one place by displaying a status widget on the project overview page.

Show at one sight whether your project is on track, at risk or off track and add important project information, such as project owner, due dates, links to important resources and more.

The project status widget contains a placeholder NOT SET when initially activated.

This way, the project overview page can be extended to a detailed reporting dashboard for your projects.

## CRUD operations for projects in API v3

The API v3 now also enables CRUD on Projects.

## Code maintenance

### Consolidate work package edit field implementation

### Upgrade to Rails 6.0.0
