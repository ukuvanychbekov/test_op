# OpenProject 10.3.0

The new release OpenProject 10.3 adds improved mobile support to OpenProject. Additionally, you can now use custom fields with right-to-left support for languages such as Arabic.

Read below to get a detailed overview of what is new in OpenProject 10.3.

## Improved mobile support

The work package view now displays a tile view of your tasks when accessed on a mobile device.
This provides a clearer structure and overview. The most important information (such as subject, assignee and status) is visible right away.

Additionally, the header menu and device menu bar are hidden to provide as much screen space as possible.

## Right-to-left support for work package long text custom fields

Work package custom fields of type "Long text" now optionally support text with a right-to-left orientation (such as Arabic).
You can use those custom fields to properly display text with a right-to-left orientation.
