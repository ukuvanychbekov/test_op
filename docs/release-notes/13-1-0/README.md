# OpenProject 13.1.0

Release date: 2023-12-13

We released [OpenProject 13.1.0](https://community.openproject.com/versions/1486).

It brings significant enhancements in our **Meetings module** and various minor adjustments, such as the integration of **Primer design system** and the introduction of a **high contrast mode** to enhance OpenProject's accessibility.

For enterprise users, two additional features have been introduced to streamline workflow efficiency within OpenProject: the capability to **share work packages externally** and the debut of a **OneDrive/SharePoint integration**.

As always, this release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version.

## Dynamic meetings and agenda items linked to work packages

You probably already know OpenProject's Meetings module. Formerly, this module restricted users to creating meeting agendas in a single text block. OpenProject 13.1 enables the **creation and management of individual agenda items**.  This includes **creating direct links to specific meetings from a work package** and provides a comprehensive overview of  the discussions and links directly to the meeting associated with the  work package.

![OpenProject dynamic meetings example](openproject-13-1-dynamic-meetings.png)

This feature, designed with the latest Primer UI components and UX  patterns, is funded by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and  Home Affairs (BMI) as part of the [openDesk](././././blog/sovereign-workplace/) project.

> Please note: The already existing classic meetings will be removed with one of the upcoming releases and only the new dynamic meetings will remain.  Migrations will be provided.

See our user guide to learn more about the [updated meetings module and how to use it](./././user-guide/meetings/dynamic-meetings/).

## OneDrive/SharePoint integration (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject already offered the file sharing integration with Nextcloud. However, we recognized that  some customers use other document storage solutions, such as Microsoft  SharePoint. This is why, alongside the already existing integration with Nextcloud, OpenProject 13.1 brings the new file sharing integration with OneDrive/SharePoint as an Enterprise add-on. This feature allows you to easily upload, link, and access SharePoint files directly from your work packages.

![SharePoint integration in OpenProject](openproject-13-1-onedrive-sharepoint-integration.png)

See our user guide to learn more about this Enterprise add-on and how to [use the SharePoint integration](././user-guide/file-management/one-drive-integration/).

## Share work packages with external users and groups (Enterprise add-on)

With OpenProject 13.1 it is possible to share work packages with users and/or groups outside of your installation. This  sharing feature is available as an Enterprise add-on. Work packages can now be shared with users or groups that have no  permissions to see a particular project in its entirety, only allowing access to relevant work packages. This way, stakeholders can get easy access to relevant  project information without having to see all of a projectâ€™s work  packages. 

![Share work packages with external users in OpenProject](openproject-13-1-share-work-packages.png)

See the user guide for [instructions on how to use this new feature](./././user-guide/work-packages/share-work-packages/).

## Attribute help texts are released into Community edition

With OpenProject 13.1, we released [Attribute help texts](./././system-admin-guide/attribute-help-texts/) for the Community edition. This allows providing explanatory help text for all project attributes, such as status, accountable or any custom field. The help text will be displayed as a small question mark icon beside the attribute, simplifying the input process and helping to avoid mistakes.

## Accessibility improvements and high contrast mode

We continued to work on improving accessibility of OpenProject according to the WCAG 2.1 AA. You can now select to use a high contrast mode in your [profile settings](./././getting-started/my-account/#select-the-high-contrast-color-mode), which will override the current OpenProject theme and be especially valuable for OpenProject users with visual impairments.

## Continued integration of Primer design system

With OpenProject 13.1 we have continued to integration the [Primer Design system](https://primer.style/). This will especially be noticeable in the new features, such as the new Meetings module.
