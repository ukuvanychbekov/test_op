# OpenProject 4.0.5

OpenProject 4.0.5 has been released which contains several bug fixes.  
We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations.

The following bugs have been fixed in the core:

  - When sorting by a version in the work package table, the result was
    not shown but an unclear error message displayed
    ([#17928](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17928 "Sorting by version leads to 500 in experimental API (\"Unable to retrieve query from URL\") (closed)")).
  - Clicking on the project name in a timeline let to “Page not found”
    ([#17819](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17819 "[Regression] Page not found when clicking on project link in timeline (NaN in link) (closed)")).
  - The “Close” icon of modals was cut off
    ([#17818](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17818 "[Regression] Close icon of modals is cut off (closed)")).
  - Dates in the work package table were sometimes not displayed properly
    ([#17043](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17043 "Single bad translation on work package table. (closed)")).
    Thanks a lot to [Mike Lewis](https://community.openproject.org/users/35400) for reporting
    this error!

Additionally, the work package export via CSV is working properly again
([#16813](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/16813 "CSV Export is fixed (closed)")).
Before, only the default columns were displayed in the exported file.  
A big thanks goes to [Thomas Tribolet](https://github.com/TribesTom) for
fixing this bug!

Finally, syntax highlighting is working again (e.g. in the wiki and
repository):

In the Translations plugin an error was fixed which caused translations
in the work package table not to be displayed properly
([#17944](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17944 "Missing js files added (closed)")).
