# OpenProject 4.0.4

OpenProject 4.0.4 (and 4.0.3) have been released which contain several
bug fixes.  
We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installations to
OpenProject 4.0.4.

## OpenProject 4.0.4

  - Due to a regression it was not possible to group by attributes which
    are not displayed in the work package table. This has been resolved
    ([#17738](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17738 "500 on WP table on grouping by non displayed column (closed)")).

## List of changes

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the
