# OpenProject 4.0.8

OpenProject 4.0.8 has been released which contains a performance bug
fix.

We advise everyone to update their OpenProject installation.

In OpenProject 4.0.7 some projects reacted very slowly when the project
contained project members which had a lot of memberships. This error
occurred especially in OpenProject instances with a large number of
projects. Since this error significantly reduced the usability, it has
been fixed in OpenProject 4.0.8.
([#18889](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/18889 "#18889")).

To get an overview of the new version, please refer to the 
[Changelog v.4.0.8](https://community.openproject.org/versions/615 "Changelog v.4.0.8")
or take a look at
[GitHub](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/v4.0.8 "GitHub OpenProject 4.0.8").
