# OpenProject 4.0.1

OpenProject 4.0.1 was released.  
The release fixes installation errors caused by an old version of
Sprockets and provides several important security fixes (including a
Rails update).  
We advise anyone to update their OpenProject installation.

Packager support for easier installation has been extended to also
include RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu
([#17165](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/17165 "Packaged based installer for RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu (closed)")).  
Find the current packager version of OpenProject here: 
[OpenProject Packager installation](https://packager.io/gh/opf/openproject).

For a complete list of changes, please refer to the 
[OpenProject 4.0.1 query](https://community.openproject.org/versions/530).
