# OpenProject 4.1.2

OpenProject 4.1.2 has been released. The new release contains
several bug fixes for the OpenProject core and plugins as well as
additional improvements.

We strongly recommend to upgrade to the current version.

**OpenProject core:**

  - The timezone in the work package view was incorrect. This has been
    fixed
    ([#20210](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20210)).
    Thanks to [Javier Mart√≠nez](https://community.openproject.org/users/39048) for
    reporting this error.
  - For subfolder installations of OpenProject, the assignee and
    responsible could not be edited. This has been fixed
    ([#20311](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20311)).
  - Due to an error, the quick reference for syntax was displayed when
    editing text fields. This has been resolved with
    [#20314](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20314).
  - An error prevented the deletion of global work package queries. This
    is working properly again with OpenProject 4.1.2
    ([#20316](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20316)).
  - Additional a number of design errors have been fixed
    ([#20305](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20305), 
    [#20306](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20306),
    [#20308](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20308),
    [#20309](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20309), 
    [#20317](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20317),
    [#20313](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20313)).

As an additional improvement, the icons in the administration section
have been updated
([#20305](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20305)).

**Backlogs plugin:**

  - The burndown chart is displayed properly again with OpenProject
    4.1.1
    ([#20312](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20312)).

**Costs plugin:**

  - An error in budget prevented the deletion of planned cost item. This
    has been fixed
    ([#20307](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20307)).

**Meetings plugin:**

  - In OpenProject 4.1.1 it was not possible to delete meetings. This
    feature has been fixed
    ([#20149](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20149)).
