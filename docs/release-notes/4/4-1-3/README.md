# OpenProject 4.1.3

OpenProject 4.1.3 contains a 
[security fix for Ruby-on-Rails](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2015/6/16/Rails-3-2-22-4-1-11-and-4-2-2-have-been-released-and-more/)
which is an important part of the software stack used by OpenProject
([#20470](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20470)).

In addition, a number of bug fixes are included in the new release:

  - Dates on the details pane were not visible for anonymous users
    ([#20266](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20266)).
  - The title was displayed twice in email notifications when creating
    new work packages
    ([#20232](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20232)).
  - An unnecessary warning message was displayed when reloading the work
    package page after adding a comment via the details pane
    ([#19515](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/19515)).

Additionally, the styling of the activities section on the details pane
has been updated
([#19788](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/19788)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the 
[Changelog v.4.1.3](https://community.openproject.org/versions/733)
