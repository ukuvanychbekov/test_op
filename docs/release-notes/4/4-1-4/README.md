# OpenProject 4.1.4

OpenProject 4.1.4 contains a bug fix and a security fix.

The following bugs have been fixed:

  - In projects with a lot of members and/or custom fields creating a
    work package could lead to an internal error (500)
    ([#21067](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/21067)).
  - In addition, a security bug has been fixed which potentially enabled
    XSS attacks.

For further information on the release, please refer to the 
[Changelog v.4.1.4](https://community.openproject.org/versions/755) 
or take a look at 
[GitHub](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/v4.1.4).
