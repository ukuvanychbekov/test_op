# OpenProject 4.2.1

OpenProject 4.2.1 contains a hotfix for the packager installation which
prevented translations from being displayed properly
([#20837](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20837)).

Additionally, some other translation related errors have been fixed:

  - In the admin area several languages were wrongly displayed as
    “English”
    ([#20801](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20801)).
  - Some translations in the work package context menu broke the layout
    ([#20835](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20835)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the 
[Changelog v.4.2.1](https://community.openproject.org/versions/731) 
or take a look at 
[GitHub](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/v4.2.1).
