# OpenProject 4.1.1

OpenProject 4.1.1 has been released which includes a bug fix for the
roadmap and a design fix.

Due to a wrong link, an internal error was displayed in OpenProject
4.1.0 when trying to edit a version from the roadmap screen. This has
been fixed with OpenProject 4.1.1
([#20094](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20094)).

Additionally, the width for the column selection screen on the work
package page has been increased
([#20095](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/20095)).

For further information on the release, please refer to the 
[Changelog v.4.1.1](https://community.openproject.org/versions/714 "Changelog v.4.0.10") 
or take a look at
[GitHub](https://github.com/opf/openproject/tree/v4.1.1 "GitHub").
