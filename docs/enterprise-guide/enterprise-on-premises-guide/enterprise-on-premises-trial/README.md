You can **test the OpenProject Enterprise on-premises edition 14 days for free**. It will extend your current Community edition with the Enterprise add-ons so you can thoroughly test those Enterprise functionalities.

You can start the trial period for OpenProject either via an already installed Community edition or via our website.
