To set a custom touch icon that appears on your smartphone’s or  tablet’s homescreen when you bookmark a page, make sure you have a PNG  file with the dimensions 180 by 180 pixels. Select the *Choose File* button and select the file from your hard drive to upload it.

## Advanced settings

Aside from uploading logos and icons, you can also customize the colors used within your OpenProject environment. 

To do this change the color values (entered as color hex code) in the *Custom Colors* section. In order to find the right hex code for a color, you can use a website, such as [color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/).
 You can see the selected color in the preview area next to the color hex code. Therefore, it is possible to see the selected color before saving the changes.
