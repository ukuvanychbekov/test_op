## Aggregation

![Administration setting email and notifications aggregation](admin-email-aggregation.png)

The setting **User actions aggregated within** specifies a time interval in which all notifications regarding a specific user's actions are bundled into one single notification. Individual actions of a user (e.g. updating a work package twice) are aggregated into a single action if their age difference is less than the specified timespan. They will be displayed as a single action within the application. This will also delay notifications by the same amount of time reducing the number of emails being sent.

## Email notifications settings

![Administration setting email notifications](admin-email-notifications.png)

1. **Emission email address**. This email address will be shown as the sender for the email notifications sent by OpenProject (for example, when a work package is changed).
2. Activate **blind carbon copy recipients** (bcc).
3. Define if the email should be formatted in **plain text** (no HTML).

The frequency of sending e-mails per work package can be set in [this way](../calendars-and-dates/#date-format).

### Configure email header and email footer

Configure your notification email header and footer which will be sent out for email notifications from the system.

![Administration setting email notifications header and footer](admin-email-notifications-header-footer.png)

1. **Formulate header and/or footer** for the email notifications. These are used for all the email notifications from OpenProject (e.g. when creating a work package).
2. **Choose a language** for which the email header and footer will apply.
3. **Send a test email**. Please note: This test email does *not* test the notifications for work package changes etc. Find out more in [this FAQ](../../installation-and-operations/installation-faq/#i-dont-receive-emails-test-email-works-fine-but-not-the-one-for-work-package-updates).
4. Do not forget to **save** your changes.

## Incoming emails settings

Here you can configure the following options.

![Administration settings incoming emails](admin-incoming-emails.png)

1. **Define after which lines an email should be truncated**. This setting allows shortening email after the entered lines.
2. Specify a **regular expression** to truncate emails.
3. **Ignore mail attachment** of the specified names in this list.
4. Do not forget to **save** the changes.
