# Integrations and Community plugins

There are various integrations and Community plugins out there. Please [contact us](https://www.openproject.org/contact/) if you want to have your plugin to be added to this list.

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to switch or need an integration to OpenProject, there is a way to do so for some applications.

> **Note**:  We do not guarantee error-free and seamless use of the Community plugins. Installation and use is at your own risk.

## Excel

Find out more about the [Excel synchronization with OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).

## GitHub

OpenProject offers a basic GitHub integration. You will find more information about the GitHub integration in our [GitHub integration guideline](./github-integration/).

## Gitlab

There is a Gitlab plugin from the community. You will find the README and the code [here](https://github.com/btey/openproject-gitlab-integration).


## Jira

Currently, there is no direct integration between OpenProject and Jira. Since OpenProject is an excellent open source alternative to Jira, we have prepared a way to import tickets from Jira to OpenProject. First, you can export your tasks from Jira into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into OpenProject](./excel-synchronization).

If you would like to learn more about the features of **OpenProject vs Jira** please read [here](https://www.openproject.org/blog/open-source-jira-alternative/).

## Mattermost

There is a user-provided integration with Mattermost. Please note that it is not officially supported and that we do not take any liability when you use it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/girish17/op-mattermost).

## Microsoft Project

There is an integration between MS Project and OpenProject. However, the synch plugin is not actively maintained at this time. If you wish to find out more, please [contact us](https://www.openproject.org/contact/).
To synchronize tasks from MS Project to OpenProject, you can export your MS Project file to Excel and then [synchronize it with OpenProject]( ./excel-synchronization/).

## Nextcloud

OpenProject offers integration with Nextcloud for file storage and collaboration. You can find more information about [setting up the integration with Nextcloud](./nextcloud) and [using the integration](../../user-guide/file-management/nextcloud-integration/).

## OneDrive/SharePoint (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject offers an integration with OneDrive/Sharepoint for file storage and collaboration. You can find more information about [setting up the integration with OneDrive/SharePoint](./one-drive) and [using the integration](../../user-guide/file-management/one-drive-integration/).

> **Note**: OneDrive/SharePoint integration is an Enterprise add-on and can only be used with [Enterprise cloud](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide/) or [Enterprise on-premises](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-on-premises-guide/). An upgrade from the free Community edition is easy and helps support OpenProject.

## Slack

There is a rudimentary OpenProject Slack integration from the community. It messages a configured Slack channel, every time a Work Package or Wiki site is modified. This integration is not officially supported by OpenProject.
To activate it in the Enterprise cloud please [get in touch](https://www.openproject.org/contact/). For the Enterprise on-premises edition and the Community edition you can find the plugin and its documentation on GitHub: [OpenProject Slack plugin](https://github.com/opf/openproject-slack)

## Time Tracker for OpenProject

[Time Tracker](https://open-time-tracker.com/) is a mobile app that records time spent on tasks and logs it to your Open Project instance.

Please keep in mind that it is not developed by OpenProject and is not supported by us. 

## Toggl
