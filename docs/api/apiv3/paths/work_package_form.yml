  summary: Work Package Edit Form

    When calling this endpoint, the client provides a single object containing the properties and links to be edited, in the body.

    Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the write operation.

    When setting start date, finish date, and duration together, their correctness will be checked and a 422 error will be returned if one value does not match with the two others. You can make the server compute a value: set only two values in the request and the third one will be computed and returned in the response. For instance, when sending `{ "startDate": "2022-08-23", duration: "P2D" }`, the response will include `{ "dueDate": "2022-08-24" }`.
