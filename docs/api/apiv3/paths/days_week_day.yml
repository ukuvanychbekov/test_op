patch:
  summary: Update a week day attributes (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
  operationId: update_week_day
  description: |-
    **(NOT IMPLEMENTED)**
    Makes a week day a working or non-working day.

    Note: changing a week day working attribute will not affect the start and
    finish dates of work packages but will affect their duration attribute.
