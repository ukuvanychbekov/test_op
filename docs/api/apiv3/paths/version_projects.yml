        Returned if the version does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
        to see it.

        **Required permission:** view work packages **or** manage versions (any project where the given version is available)

        *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a version.
        That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

    but are also limited to the projects that the current user is allowed to see.
