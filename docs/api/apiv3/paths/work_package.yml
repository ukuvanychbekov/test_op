        In order to perform a [baseline comparison](/docs/api/baseline-comparisons) of the work-package attributes, you may
        provide one or several timestamps in ISO-8601 format as comma-separated list. The timestamps may be absolute or relative,
        such as ISO8601 dates, ISO8601 durations and the following relative date keywords: "oneDayAgo@HH:MM+HH:MM",
        "lastWorkingDay@HH:MM+HH:MM", "oneWeekAgo@HH:MM+HH:MM", "oneMonthAgo@HH:MM+HH:MM".
        The first "HH:MM" part represents the zero paded hours and minutes.
        The last "+HH:MM" part represents the timezone offset from UTC associated with the time,
        the offset can be positive or negative e.g."oneDayAgo@01:00+01:00", "oneDayAgo@01:00-01:00".

        Usually, the first timestamp is the baseline date, the last timestamp is the current date.
        Values older than 1 day are accepted only with valid Enterprise Token available.

    When calling this endpoint the client provides a single object, containing the properties and links that it wants
    to change, in the body. Note that it is only allowed to provide properties or links supporting the **write**
    operation.

    Additionally to the fields the client wants to change, it is mandatory to provide the value of `lockVersion` which
    was received by the `GET` request this change originates from.

    The value of `lockVersion` is used to implement
    [optimistic locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).
