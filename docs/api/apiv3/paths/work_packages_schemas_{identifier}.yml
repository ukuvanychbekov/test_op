        Returned if the schema does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
        to see it.

        **Required permission:** view work packages (on the project where this schema is used)

        *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a project.
        That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*
