        Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions to see the budgets of the given
        project.

        **Required permission:** view work packages **or** view budgets

        *Note that you will only receive this error, if you are at least allowed to see the corresponding project.*

      description: |-
        Returned if either:

        * the project does not exist

        * the client does not have sufficient permissions to see the project

        * the costs module is not enabled on the given project

        **Required permission:** view project

        *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a project.
        That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*
