  Depending on custom fields defined for users, additional properties might exist.

  The `status` of a user can be one of:

  * `active` - the user can log in with the account right away

  * `invited` - the user is invited and is pending registration

  If the user's `status` is set to `active` during creation a means of authentication
  has to be provided which is one of the following:

  * `password` - The password with which the user logs in.

  * `auth_source` - Link to an LDAP auth source.

  * `identity_url` - The identity URL of an OmniAuth authentication provider.

  If all of these are missing the creation will fail with an "missing password" error.

  The `language` is limited to those activated in the system.

  Due to data privacy, the user's properties are limited to reveal as little about the user as possible.
  Thus `login`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `language`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are hidden for all
  users except for admins or the user themselves.

  Please note that custom fields are not yet supported by the api although the backend supports them.
