  Projects are containers structuring the information (e.g. work packages, wikis) into smaller groups. They can be used in a classic project management approach but also when structuring work by departments.

  As containers, they also control behaviour of the elements within them. One of the most important aspects of this is that projects limit permissions by having members with a certain permission set (roles) assigned to them.

  Depending on custom fields defined for projects, additional links might exist.

  Note, that the parent and ancestor links may contain the "undisclosed uri" `urn:openproject-org:api:v3:undisclosed` in case an
  ancestor project is defined but the client lacks permission to see it. See the
  [general introduction into links' properties](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/basic-objects/#local-properties) for more information.
