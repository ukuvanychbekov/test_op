  Notifications are created through notifiable actions in OpenProject.
  Notifications are triggered by actions carried out in the system by users, e.g. editing a work package, but can also be send out because
  of time passing e.g. when a user is notified of a work package that is overdue.

  This endpoint only returns in-app notifications.
