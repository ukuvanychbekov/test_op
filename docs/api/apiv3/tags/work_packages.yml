  Note that the properties listed here only cover the built-in properties of the OpenProject Core.
  Using plug-ins and custom fields a work package might contain various additional properties.
  A client can consult the schema information to which the work package links. The schema will contain information about
  all properties of the linking work package, including properties added by plug-ins and custom fields.

  Custom fields are identified by a key in the form of `customFieldN`, where `N` is an integer. Depending on their type,
  they can occur as properties or as linked properties. A client has to consult the schema to resolve
  the human readable name of custom fields.

  Properties that cannot be set directly on parent work packages are inferred from their children instead:

  * `startDate` is the earliest start date from its children if manual scheduling is activated.

  * `dueDate` is the latest finish date from its children if manual scheduling is activated.

  * `estimatedTime` is the sum of estimated times from its children

  * `percentageDone` is the weighted average of the sum of its children percentages done. The weight is given by the average of its children estimatedHours. However, if the percentage done is given by a work package's status, then only the status matters and no value is inferred.

  `startDate` can also not be earlier than a finish date of any predecessor.

  While attachments are returned as a link which's content is to be fetched separately, clients can choose to
  replace the work package's attachments by providing an array of already uploaded [Attachment resources](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/attachments/) 
  on [create](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/work-packages/#create-work-package)
  and [update](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/work-packages/#update-a-work-package). The attachments the work package has had prior to the request will be removed.
