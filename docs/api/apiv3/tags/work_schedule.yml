name: Work Schedule
description: |-
  The work schedule defines if days are working days or non-working days.

  A day can be a non-working day if any of these two conditions are met:

    - the day is a recurring non-working week day: a weekend day. For instance
      Sunday is not worked in most countries;
    - the day has been defined as a non-working day: national bank holidays or
      other days deemed special. For instance the 1st of January is New Year's
      day and is a bank holiday in most countries.

  Endpoints can define which week days are working/non-working days, and which
  dates are non-working days.

  To represent the work schedule, `Day`, `WeekDay`, and `NonWorkingDay` models are used.
