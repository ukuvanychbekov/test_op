  An action is a change one can trigger within the OpenProject instance.
  This could be creating a work package, exporting work packages or updating a user.
  An action can also be something where the user is able to be involved so where the user is in the passive role
  e.g. when being assigned a work package.

  A capability combines an action with a context and a principal. It thus communicates, which principal can carry out
  (or be passively involved) which action within a certain context. E.g. a user might have the capability of creating work packages
  within a project.

  In other words, an action is independent of a principal and context while a capability is
  a relation between an action, the context and the principal.

  The actions are most of the time derived from permissions which can be configured via the administrative UI where an administrator
  selects from a set of permissions to be granted per role. But there are other cases, e.g. in order to become assignee or responsible of a work package, a user has
  to have a role which allows having work packages assigned which is not a permission.

  Even though user might have a capability, it might still not be possible to carry out the action
  because some other requirement is not met.
  E.g. a user might have the capability to update work packages, but if a particular work package is
  in a readonly state, that work package cannot be updated.

  *Only a small set of actions that actually already exist in the system are currently exposed via
  the api. They will be added over time.*

  ## Action

  An action describes what can be carried out within the application. Until an action becomes assigned,
  which turns it into a capability, it remains in the state of "could be".

  ## Capabilities

  Actions can be assigned to a principal by assigning roles to that principal. E.g. a user might receive the 'work_packages/show'
  action by having a role called reader assigned within a project.

  Whenever a principal is assigned an action within a context, the principal has additional capabilities.

  Exactly which actions can be gained by having a role assigned depends on the configuration of that role.
  The configuration is adaptable by admins within the administration of the OpenProject instance.
