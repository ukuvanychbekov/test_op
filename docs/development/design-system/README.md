# Design System and Component Libraries

Starting in OpenProject 13.0., the [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/design/) is being used in OpenProject. Relevant reusable components from Primer as well as common patterns and compositions of these components will be documented in our [Lookbook](https://qa.openproject-edge.com/lookbook/).

Prior to 13.0., components were defined in its own Design System called SPOT which is slowly being replaced by Primer.
Components still defined for SPOT are documented in the last build of storybook found
