# OpenProject development setup via docker

The quickest way to get started developing OpenProject is to use the docker setup.

## Requirements

* docker

And nothing else!

## Quickstart

To get right into it and just start the application you can just do the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opf/openproject.git
cd openproject
cp .env.example .env
cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker compose run --rm backend setup
docker compose run --rm frontend npm install
docker compose up -d frontend
```

Once the containers are done booting you can access the application under `http://localhost:3000`.

### Tests

You can run tests inside the `backend-test` container. You can run specific tests, too.

```shell
# Run all tests (not recommended)
docker compose run --rm backend-test bundle exec rspec

# Run the specified test
docker compose run --rm backend-test bundle exec rspec spec/features/work_package_show_spec.rb
```

***

More details and options follow in the next section.


> **Note**: docker compose needs access to at least 4GB of RAM. E.g. for Mac, this requires
> to [increase the default limit of the virtualized host](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).
> Signs of lacking memory include an "Exit status 137" in the frontend container.

## Step-by-step Setup

### 1) Checkout the code

First you will need to check out the code as usual.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opf/openproject.git
```

This will check out the dev branch in `openproject`. **Change into that directory.**

If you have OpenProject checked out already make sure that you do not have a `config/database.yml`
as that will interfere with the database connection inside the docker containers.

### 2) Configure environment

Copy the env example to `.env`

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Afterward, set the environment variables to your liking. `DEV_UID` and `DEV_GID` are required to be set so your project
directory will not end up with files owned by root.

`docker compose` will load the env from this file.

You also will want to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file, which can contain the port exposure for your
containers. Those are excluded from the main compose file `docker-compose.yml` for sanity reasons. If any port is
already in use, `docker compose` won't start and as you cannot disable the exposed port in
the `docker-compose.override.yml` file, you would have to alter the original `docker-compose.yml`.

There is an example you can use out of the box.

```shell
cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

### 3) Setup database and install dependencies

```shell
# This will start the database as a dependency
# and then run the migrations and seeders,
# and will install all required server dependencies
docker compose run --rm backend setup

# This will install the web dependencies 
docker compose run --rm frontend npm install
```

### 4) Start the stack

The docker compose file also has the test containers defined. The easiest way to start only the development stack, use

```shell
docker compose up frontend
```

If you want to see the backend logs, too.

```shell
docker compose up frontend backend
```

Alternatively, if you do want to detach from the process you can use the `-d` option.

```shell
docker compose up -d frontend
```

The logs can still be accessed like this.

```shell
# Print the logs of the `frontend` service until the time you execute this command
docker compose logs frontend

# Print the logs of the `backend` service and follow the log outputs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Those commands only start the frontend and backend containers and their dependencies. This excludes the workers, which
are needed to execute certain background actions. Nevertheless, for most interactions the worker jobs are not needed. If
needed, the workers can be started with the following command. Be aware that this process will consume a lot of the
system's resources.

```shell
# Start the worker service and let it run continuously
docker compose up -d worker

# Start the worker service to work off all delayed jobs and shut it down afterwards
docker compose run --rm worker rake jobs:workoff
```

The testing containers are excluded as well, while they are harmless to start, but take up system resources again and
clog your logs while running. The delayed_job background worker reloads the application for every job in development
mode. This is a know issue and documented here: https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/issues/823

This process can take quite a long time on the first run where all gems are installed for the first time. However, these
are cached in a docker volume. Meaning that from the 2nd run onwards it will start a lot quicker.

Wait until you see `âœ” Compiled successfully.` in the frontend logs and the success message from Puma in the backend
logs. This means both frontend and backend have come up successfully. You can now access OpenProject
under http://localhost:3000, and via the live-reloaded under http://localhost:4200.

Again the first request to the server can take some time too. But subsequent requests will be a lot faster.

Changes you make to the code will be picked up automatically. No need to restart the containers.

### Volumes

There are volumes for

* the attachments (`_opdata`)
* the database (`_pgdata`)
* the bundle (rubygems) (`_bundle`)
* the tmp directory (`_tmp`)
* the test database (`_pgdata-test`)
* the test tmp directory (`_tmp-test`)

This means these will stay between runs even if you stop (or remove) and restart the containers. If you want to reset
the data you can delete the docker volumes via `docker volume rm`.

## Running tests

Start all linked containers and migrate the test database first:

```shell
docker compose up -d backend-test
```

Afterward, you can start the tests in the running `backend-test` container:

```shell
docker compose exec backend-test bundle exec rspec
```

or for running a particular test

```shell
docker compose exec backend-test bundle exec rspec path/to/some_spec.rb
```

Tests are ran within Selenium containers, on a small local Selenium grid. You can connect to the containers via VNC if
you want to see what the browsers are doing. `gvncviewer` or `vinagre` on Linux is a good tool for this. Set any port in
the `docker-compose.override.yml` to access a container of a specific browser. As a default, the `chrome` container is
exposed on port 5900. The password is `secret` for all.

## TLS support

Within `docker/dev/tls` compose files are provided, that elevate the development stack to be run under full TLS
encryption. This simulates much more accurately production environments, and it allows you to connect other services
into your development stack. This needs a couple of steps of more setup complexity, so you should only proceed, if you
really need or want it.

As an overview, you need to take the following, additional steps:

1. Set up a local certificate authority and reverse proxy
2. Extract created root certificate and install it into system and browsers
3. Amend docker containers with labels for proxy

At the end you will be running two separate docker-compose stacks:

1. the normal stack in the root of the repository, and
2. the stack defined in `docker/dev/tls` that runs the CA and reverse proxy.

If the setup is successful, you will be able to access the local OpenProject application
under `https://openproject.local`. Of course, the host name is replaceable.

### Resolving host names

The current setup uses a simplified way to resolve host names. In order to do so, we redirect all host names, that
should be resolved by the proxy, to localhost. The `traefik` proxy is configured to listen to the localhost ports `80`
and `443` and redirect those requests to the specific container. To make it happen, you need to add every hostname you
define for your services to your `/etc/hosts`.

```shell
127.0.0.1   openproject.local traefik.local
::1         openproject.local traefik.local
```

#### DNS? Where are you?

We have plans to add a local DNS to this development setup, making two things possible:

1. No requirement to amend your `/etc/hosts` file anymore.
2. Being accessible from another device within your internal network (e.g. a cellphone).

### Local certificate authority

We use [traefik](https://traefik.io/) as a reverse proxy and [step-ca](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/) as a local
certificate authority, so that you can enhance your development setup with TLS encryption without being forced to have
an active internet connection. A compose file exists that runs those two services.

```shell
# Create a file that serves as a certificate store
touch docker/dev/tls/acme.json
chmod 0600 docker/dev/tls/acme.json

# Create external docker network
docker network create gateway

# Start certificate authority and reverse proxy
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls up -d

# OPTIONAL: Change certificate duration to 1y - the values can be changed to any desired value
# restart stack afterwards
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls exec step step ca provisioner \
  update acme --x509-min-dur=24h --x509-max-dur=8760h --x509-default-dur=8760h
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls stop
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls up -d
```

`step` will create the root CA, which is later stored in a persisted volume. You need to install this root CA on your
machine and your browsers, so that any issued certificate is considered trusted. This process however is very dependent
on your OS.

When requesting TLS certificates `step` will make TLS challenges. For this reason we need to amend the `traefik` service
and add aliases with the domain names of each service, that needs TLS-encrypted access. We prepared an example file
at `docker/dev/tls/docker-compose.override.example.yml`.

```shell
# Copy the override example
cp docker/dev/tls/docker-compose.override.example.yml docker/dev/tls/docker-compose.override.yml
```

### Install root CA

In this section you can find the ways, of how to make the just generated root CA available to your machine, the docker
container and your browser.

#### Browser

You need to import the created root certificate into the browser you use. Be aware, that the certificate you want to
import cannot be located in a directory only accessible by root users, as the browser won't be able to import from
there. Instead, you can copy the certificate from the docker container to any temporary location.

```shell
# Copy root certificate to any temporary location
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls cp step:/home/step/certs/root_ca.crt $HOME/tmp/root_ca.crt
```

The installation of the certificate into the browser depends on the browser you are using, so you should check the docs
for that specific browser.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian, you need to add the generated root CA to system certificates bundle.

```shell
# Copy the .crt file into CA certificate location.
# You need `sudo` permission to execute this.
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls cp \
 step:/home/step/certs/root_ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/OpenProject_Development_Root_CA.crt

# Create symbolic link   
ln -s /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/OpenProject_Development_Root_CA.crt /etc/ssl/certs/OpenProject_Development_Root_CA.pem

# Update certificate bundle
update-ca-certificates
```

After that the generated root CA should be inside `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

#### NixOS

On NixOS, you need to add the generated root CA to system certificates bundle. To do so, you need to persist the
certificate on your system.

```shell
# Copy the .crt file into a persisted location in your file system.
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls cp step:/home/step/certs/root_ca.crt path_to_root_ca.crt
```

Add the following option to your NixOS configuration:

```text
security.pki.certificateFiles = [ path_to_root_ca.crt ];
```

Then rebuild your system. After that the generated root CA should be inside `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

### Reverse proxy

After installing the root CA on your system, you need to start the reverse proxy, which now should be able to verify the
issued certificated requested from `step-ca`.

```shell
# Restart full proxy and ca stack
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls down
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls up -d
```

It will take a couple of seconds to start, as there is a health check in the step container.

### Amend docker services

The docker services of the `docker-compose.yml` need additional information to be able to run in the local setup with
TLS support. Basically, you need to tell `traefik` for which docker compose service it needs to create a HTTP router.
There is an example compose file (see `docker/dev/tls/docker-compose.core-override.example.yml`), which contents you can
take over to your custom `docker-compose.override.yml` in the repository root.

In addition, we need to alter the environmental variables used in the new overrides. So we need to amend the `.env` file
like that:

```shell
OPENPROJECT_DEV_HOST=openproject.local
OPENPROJECT_DEV_URL=https://${OPENPROJECT_DEV_HOST}
```

After amending the override file and the `.env`, ensure that you restart the stack.

```shell
docker compose up -d frontend
```

### Adding a new service

Some development tasks require you to run separate services that interact with OpenProject. For example, you might want
to have Nextcloud running to test the Nextcloud-OpenProject integration. To do this, you'll need to follow some steps:

1. Add the Nextcloud service to your `docker-compose.override.yml`, with the appropriate traefik labels, network, and
   ca-bundle mounted.
2. Make sure step-ca can reach it to validate it for SSH. In `docker/dev/tls/docker-compose.override.yml`, add the host
   to the `aliases` section of the traefik networking.

### Troubleshooting

After this setup you should be able to access your OpenProject development instance at `https://openproject.local`. If
something went wrong, check if your problem is listed here.

#### Certificate invalid

At times, the issued certificate has a wrong start date. This is a known problem, that happens when the system clock is
synchronized after the certificate was issued from `traefik`. This usually can occur, if the docker process was
suspended and continued at a later time. To fix it, restart your proxy stack.

```shell
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls down
docker compose --project-directory docker/dev/tls up -d
```

## Local files

Running the docker images will change some of your local files in the mounted code directory. The
file `frontend/package-lock.json` may be modified. You can just reset these changes if you want to commit something or
pull the latest changes.

## Debugging

It's common to just start a debugger within ruby code using `binding.pry`. This works as expected with the application
running as shown above.

However, keep in mind that you won't see the pry console unless you attach to the container of the `backend` service.
The easiest way to do that is getting the container name from the docker compose list and attaching to it with the
standard docker command.

```shell
# Check all running services and their containers.
# As a default the `backend` container has the name `openproject-backend-1`
docker compose ps

# Attach to the container
docker attach openproject-backend-1
```

Inside the `backend` container you have a standard rails console. If you attached to the container **after** you run
into your breakpoint, you won't see the common lines pry will print before your prompt.

To detach from the `backend` container without stopping it, you can use `CTRL+P, CTRL+Q`. Using `CTRL+C` works, too, but
it will close and restart the backend container.

## Updates

When a dependency of the image or the base image itself is changed you may need rebuild the image. For instance when the
Ruby version is updated you may run into an error like the following when
running `docker compose run --rm backend setup`:

```
Your Ruby version is 2.7.6, but your Gemfile specified ~> 3.2.1
```

This means that the current image is out-dated. You can update it like this:

```shell
docker compose build --pull
```
