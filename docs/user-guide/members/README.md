## Add members

## Roles and permissions

Members will have different roles with different permissions in a project. To find out how to configure roles and permissions click [here](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions).

<div class="glossary">
A **role** is defined as a set of permissions defined by a unique name. Project members are assigned to a project by specifying a user's, group's or placeholder user's name and the role(s) they should assume in the project.
</div>

To assign work packages to a project member, the respective user's or placeholder user's role needs to be able to be assigned work packages. This is the default setting for default roles. You can check this setting in the [Roles and Permissions section](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions/) of the system administration.


## Groups

Users can be added to groups. A group can be added to a project. With this, all users within a group will have the corresponding role in this project. 
Find out how to create and manage groups in OpenProject [here](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/groups).
