# Keyboard Shortcuts and Access Keys

OpenProject (since version 3.0) offers useful keyboard shortcuts to  enhance your productivity. We use both access keys and regular  shortcuts. When using access keys, press the modifier keys and the  access key number. For the regular shortcuts just type the listed keys  on any OpenProject page.

## Save text in rich editor

To quickly save changes in a rich text editor (for example a work package description or a comment) you can use this shortcut.

| Shortcut (Windows / Linux) | Shortcut (Mac) | Action                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CTRL + ENTER               | CMD + ENTER    | **Save changes.** <br />For inline-editable fields, save the field and close it.<br />For pages with a full WYSIWYG (meetings, wiki pages), submit the form. |
