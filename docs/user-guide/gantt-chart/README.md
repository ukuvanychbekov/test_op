# Gantt charts

<div class="glossary">
The **Gantt chart** in OpenProject displays the work packages in a timeline. You can collaboratively create and manage your project plan. Have your project timelines available for all team members and share up-to-date information with stakeholders. You can add start and finish dates and adapt it with drag and drop in the Gantt chart. Also, you can add dependencies, predecessor or follower within the Gantt chart.

## Activate the Gantt chart

A Gantt chart can be activated in any work package table, to display the work packages in a timeline view.

To activate the Gantt chart, select the **Gantt** icon at the top right corner of the work package table.

![activate-gantt](activate-gantt.gif)

## Create a new element in the Gantt chart

To add a work package (e.g. phase, milestone or task) to a Gantt chart, click the **+ Create new work package** link at the bottom of the work package table view.

You can add a subject and make changes to type, status or more fields.

In the **Gantt chart** you can schedule the work package with drag and drop and change the duration.

To **change the order of an item** in the Gantt chart, click the **drag and drop** icon (6 dots) at the left hand side of the work package row. Drag the item to the new position. The blue horizontal line indicates the new position to drop the element.

![create-new-element-gantt-chart](create-new-element-gantt-chart.gif)

### How to change the duration of an element in the Gantt chart

To change the duration of a work package in the Gantt chart view, hover over the work package in the Gantt chart and use the little arrows on its ends to adjust the start date or finish date. This will shorten or prolong its duration. To move a work package on the time line just click on it and drag and drop it to the desired point of time. This will change its start and finish date.

> **Note**: The Gantt chart will highlight non-working days with a darker background colour when you are zoomed in to a level that shows individual days. By default, a work package cannot be dragged or resized such that it begins or ends on these days unless the "Working days only" switch is turned off for that work package. To learn how to do this, refer to the documentation on [Working days and duration](../work-packages/set-change-dates/#working-days-and-duration).
>
> Work packages can also expand and retract in width depending on how many non-working days are spanned (for example, a 3-day task starting on Thursday and ending on Monday will spread across 5 calendar days;  dragging that same work package so that it starts on a Tuesday and ends on a Thursday means that it will spread across 3 calendar days. In both cases, the duration remains 3 days.

## Relations in the Gantt chart

You can track dependencies of work packages (e.g. phases, milestones, tasks) in the Gantt chart. This way, you can get an easy overview of what needs to be done in which order, e.g. what tasks need to be completed to achieve a milestone.

To add a dependency, right-click on an element in the Gantt chart.

In the menu, choose **Add predecessor** or **Add follower**.

Select the item to which you want to create a dependency. The precede and follow relation is marked with a small blue line in the Gantt chart.


![dependencies-gantt-chart](dependencies-gantt-chart-1566556144225.gif)

*OpenProject does not yet include a baseline feature to compare scheduled versions. However, we are aware of the need for it and documented it. Please check [here](https://community.openproject.com/wp/26448) for an update.*

When work packages have a precedes/follows relationship:

- A follower cannot be moved to start earlier the finish date of its predecessor.
- Moving a predecessor past the start date of the the follower will automatically push the follower into the future (such that it starts the next working day).
- If there is a gap between the predecessor and the follower, either one can be moved forwards or backwards without affecting the other as long as long as the dates do not overlap.

Scheduling modes can also affect work package relations. Read about [automatic and manual scheduling](scheduling) to find out more.

> **Note:** Relations other than predecessor/follower and parent/child (such as related to, blocked by, includes, duplicates) are not displayed in the Gantt chart. To find out more, read our guide on [work package relations](../work-packages/work-package-relations-hierarchies).

## Understanding the colors and lines in the Gantt chart

- A **blue line** connects two work packages, they are predecessor and follower.
- The **vertical red dotted line** indicates today's date.
- A **black clamp** indicates the duration from the start date of a work packages earliest starting child until the end date of a work packages latest ending child.
- A **red clamp** indicates the same as the black clamp, with an important difference: The clamp turns red if the dates derived from the children are before or after the manually scheduled dates (of this parent work package).
  The clamps are black in case the derived dates are within the set dates (of this parent).
- A **diamond symbol** stands for a milestone.
- A **bar** stands for work packages like phases and tasks.



## Gantt chart configuration

To open the Gantt chart configuration, please open the **settings** icon with the three dots on the upper right of the work package module.
Choose **Configure view ...** and select the tab **Gantt chart**.

Here you can **adapt the Zoom level**, or choose Auto zoom which will select a Zoom level which best fits to your browser size to have optimal results on a page.

Also, you have **Label Configuration** for your Gantt chart. You can add up to three additional labels within the chart: On the left, on the right and on the far right. Just select which additional information you would need to have in the Gantt chart. This can be especially relevant if you want to print your Gantt chart.

Click the **Apply** button to save your changes.

![configure-gantt-chart](configure-gantt-chart.gif)

### How to export data from a Gantt diagram

To export the data from your Gantt chart there are several possibilities:

* [Export via the work package view](../work-packages/edit-work-package/#export-work-packages)
* [Print (e.g. to PDF)](#how-to-print-a-gantt-chart)
* [Synchronize data from OpenProject to Excel](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/excel-synchronization/) ←→ MS Project

### How to print a Gantt chart

The Gantt chart can be printed via the browser's printing function. It is optimized for Chrome.

First, make sure to **add the labels** you will need in the Gantt chart, e.g. Start date, Finish date, Subject, in the [Gantt chart configuration](#gantt-chart-configuration).

Choose the **Auto zoom** by clicking on the Auto zoom button on top of the Gantt chart.

Optimize the screen by dragging the Gantt chart to the far left so that only the Gantt chart is seen.

Then, **press CTRL + P** to print the Gantt chart view.

Make sure you select **Landscape** as a print layout.

In the settings, enable the **Background graphics** for printing.

Press the **Print** button.

![print-gantt-chart](print-gantt-chart.gif)

For other browsers, please simply follow the browser's printing instruction to optimize results.

To synchronize your work package data between OpenProject and Excel (two-way synchronization) please have a look at [this instruction](../../system-admin-guide/integrations/excel-synchronization/).

## Gantt chart views

### Zoom in the Gantt chart

To zoom in and zoom out in the Gantt chart view, click on the button with the **+** and **- icon** on top of the chart.

![zoom-in-Gantt-chart](image-20210204173135173.png)



### Auto zoom

Select the **auto zoom button** on top of the Gantt chart to have the best view of your Gantt chart.

![auto-zoom-Gantt](image-20210204173248266.png)



### Zen mode

The zen mode gives you more space to focus on the tasks at hand. It's almost like activating the full screen view in your browser. To exit press the *Esc* key or click on the **zen mode** symbol again.

![zen-mode-Gantt-chart](image-20210204173420592.png)


## Multi project views

With the Gantt charts in OpenProject you can create project overarching timelines.

Create multi project timelines  and display all activities, phases and milestones within your project and sub-projects. Also, you can create project overarching timelines by filtering and including respective projects in one joint plan.

To include sub-projects: within the parent project, click on the Filter button and select the subproject(s) you want to have included in your project plan. You can also choose an [aggregation by project](#aggregation-by-project).

Use the filter and grouping options as for the [work packages table configuration](../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/) to customize your timeline. Do not forget to [save your timeline](../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/#save-work-package-views).

![OpenProject-overarching-project-planning](OpenProject-overarching-project-planning.png)

If you want to adjust your work package table and filter, sort or order your work packages to have a better overview in your Gantt chart, please refer to the section [work package table configuration](../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/).

## Aggregation by project

You can get a **quick overview of multiple projects** in the Gantt chart. To accomplish this navigate to the Work packages module of a project or the [project overarching work package table](../projects/#project-overarching-reports).

**Group the work packages** by project by using the [work packages table configuration](../work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/#flat-list-hierarchy-mode-and-group-by) (accessible in the upper right corner) or by clicking on the small triangle next to "Project" in the table header.
 ![group-by-project](image-20201211020614221.png)

**Display the Gantt chart** by clicking on the button in the upper right corner.
![insert-gantt-chart-button](image-20201211020748715.png)

Use the minus next to the project's name or the **collapse button** in the upper right corner to collapse some or all projects.

![collapse-button](collapse-all-expand-all.png)

This will give you an **aggregated view of the projects' milestones**.

![aggregated-projects-milestones](image-20201211131511543.png)

**Please note**: If you want to make use of this feature, it is necessary to add milestones for the most important dates to your projects. At the moment this feature is not available for other [work package types](../../getting-started/work-packages-introduction/#what-is-a-work-package). 
Apart from the set filters the list of displayed projects depends on your [permissions](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/roles-permissions/). You can only see private projects that you are a member of and public projects.
In some cases (many work packages per project) you will have to increase the objects per page in bottom right corner to display multiple projects. Change the available options in the [system settings](../../system-admin-guide/system-settings/general-settings/) if necessary.
