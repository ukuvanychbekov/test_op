# Time tracking and cost reporting

Time and costs functionality in OpenProject allows keeping track of the resources,  both in terms of labor and budgets. With OpenProject you can always keep control of the time and costs planned for and spent on the projects.

Create budgets, log time and costs on specific work packages and create time and cost reports based on your needs.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Does OpenProject provide resource management?

Please note that OpenProject currently does not yet support resource management. However, this is scheduled in our [roadmap](https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/roadmap) as one of our main topics. Our [use cases](../../use-cases/resource-management/) provide examples for workarounds to support resource management within OpenProject.
