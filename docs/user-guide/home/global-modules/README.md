# Global modules

Global modules present an overview of the projects of which you are a member or have permissions to see. On this page, you will find a summary of all the sidebar menu entries for module across all your projects, such as **Activity, Work packages, Calendars, Boards**, etc.

To access the **Global modules** side menu, simply click on the logo in the header.

> It is possible that some of the global modules are not visible to you. This will be the case if said module is not activated in the [Project settings](../../projects/project-settings/) in any of the active projects in you instance. If, for example, the **News** module is not enabled in any of the active projects, you will not see it in the **Global modules** menu.

## Projects
