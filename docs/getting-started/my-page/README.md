## My Page introduction

My Page is your personal dashboard where you can display important information of your projects. This personal dashboard contains information from all your projects. **My page** can be configured according to your preferences. You can include project information, for example the latest news, work packages assigned to you or reported work packages.

You can open your **My page** by clicking on your user avatar in the upper right corner and then selecting **My page** from the dropdown menu.

### Change the size of a widget

If you click the dots on the lower right hand corner in a widget you can change the size of a widget by pulling the widget left and right, up and down with the mouse.



### Configure the view of a widget (for work package tables)

You can configure the view of a work package widget to have the information included that you need.

<div class="glossary">
**Work package** is a subset of a project that can be assigned to users for execution, such as Tasks, Bugs, User Stories, Milestones, and more. Work packages have a type, an ID and a subject and may have additional attributes, such as assignee, responsible, story points or target version. Work packages are displayed in a project timeline (unless they are filtered out in the timeline configuration) - either as a milestone or as a phase. In order to use the work packages, the work package module has to be activated in the project settings.
</div>

You can configure the work package table (e.g. filter, group, highlight, sort) according to the [filter, sorting and grouping criteria for work packages](../../user-guide/work-packages/work-package-table-configuration/).
