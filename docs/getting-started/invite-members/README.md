# Invite members

In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a member of a project. Therefore, you have to **add team members to a project**.

<div class="glossary">
**Member** is defined as a project member in a project. Project members are added in the Members module in the project menu.
</div>

> **Note**: If you are not a member of a project, you do not see the project in the Project selection nor in the project list.

## View members

To view the list of **all project members and their roles** in the project, select Members in the project menu.

![invite members](invite-members.png)

## Add existing users

To add existing users, [placeholder users](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/placeholder-users) or groups to a project, [select the project](../projects/#open-an-existing-project) for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** module.

In the [members list](#view-members) you will get an overview of the current members of this project.

Click the green **+ Member** button in the top right corner.

Type the name of the user, placeholder user or group which you want to add. You can also choose several members at once. **Assign a role** to the new member(s) and click the blue **Add** button.

Please note that you will have to click on the new member's name or press the Enter key before clicking the Add button.

## Invite new members

You can also invite users who do not have an OpenProject account, yet. There are different ways to do it.

**Invite in members module**

[Select the project](../projects/#open-an-existing-project) for which you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** module.

Type in the email address of the new member. If OpenProject does not find an existing user, the **Invite** information will automatically be put before the email address. Press the Enter key or select the text "Invite ...". Assign a role to this new member and click the blue **Add** button.

An email invitation will be sent out to the user with a link to [create an account](../sign-in-registration/#create-a-new-account) for OpenProject.

**Invite from header**

In the header menu that is always present, you find a green button that allows you to create projects, work packages and invite users from wherever in the application you are.

![green button for project creation](create-project-button.png)

Once clicked on **Invite user**, a pop up comes up where you decide to which project you invite the new members and which roles they get.

![invite user pop up](invite-user-pop-up.png)

**Invite within a work package**

When you are working in the work package table, you can also invite users from there. For example when you want to set an assignee for a work package that has not got access to OpenProject yet, you can select Invite from the drop down. The same applies to accountables or custom fields for your project.

![invite user over assignment](invite-user-over-assignment.png)

You can now collaborate with your team in OpenProject. Newly invited users will be shown with a letter symbol next to their name.

Please note that removing a member who has not accepted the invite yet from a project will lead to the deletion of this user, which can't be reversed.



## Behavior of groups as project members

Groups have the following impact on a project members list and behave slightly different than individual users:

- the group name is shown as a separate line on the project members list
- the group members cannot be removed from the members list individually (no delete icon)
- adding a group with members who are already in a project member list will add the group's role to their (the members') project roles
- a project member belonging to a group can have additional roles added individually
- the group's role cannot be changed for individual group members

Find out more about the management of groups [here](../../system-admin-guide/users-permissions/groups/).



## Behavior of placeholder users as project members

Placeholder will look slightly different from regular users in a project member list:

- will be shown without email address
- can't be part of a group, i.e. they will be shown without group affiliation
