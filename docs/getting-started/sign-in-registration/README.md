Please follow the [instructions in our Enterprise cloud edition guide](../../enterprise-guide/enterprise-cloud-guide/sign-in).

Please click the link in the invitation email:

> **Note**: OpenProject is available in more than 30 languages. If you do not find your preferred language, it first needs to be activated in the system's administration. Please talk to your system administrator so set up the language.
