                  ### Sprint planning meeting

                  _Please document here topics to the Sprint planning meeting_

                  * Time boxed (8 h)
                  * Input: Product Backlog
                  * Output: Sprint Backlog

                  * Divided into two additional time boxes of 4 h:

                      * The Product Owner presents the [Product Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs) and the priorities to the team and explains the Sprint Goal, to which the team must agree. Together, they prioritize the topics from the Product Backlog which the team will take care of in the next sprint. The team commits to the discussed delivery.
                      * The team plans autonomously (without the Product Owner) in detail and breaks down the tasks from the discussed requirements to consolidate a [Sprint Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs).


                  ### Daily Scrum meeting

                  _Please document here topics to the Daily Scrum meeting_

                  * Short, daily status meeting of the team.
                  * Time boxed (max. 15 min).
                  * Stand-up meeting to discuss the following topics from the [Task board](##sprint:scrum_project__version__sprint_1).
                      * What do I plan to do until the next Daily Scrum?
                      * What has blocked my work (Impediments)?
                  * Scrum Master moderates and notes down [Sprint Impediments](##sprint:scrum_project__version__sprint_1).
                  * Product Owner may participate may participate in order to stay informed.

                  ### Sprint Review meeting

                  * The team shows the product owner and other interested persons what has been achieved in this sprint.
                  * Important: no dummies and no PowerPoint! Just finished product functionality (Increments) should be demonstrated.
                  * Feedback from Product Owner, stakeholders and others is desired and will be included in further work.
                  * Based on the demonstrated functionalities, the Product Owner decides to go live with this increment or to develop it further. This possibility allows an early ROI.
