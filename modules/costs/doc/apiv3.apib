## list Cost Entries of a work package [GET]

+ Parameters
    + id (required, integer, `1`) ... work package id

+ Response 200 (application/hal+json)

    [Cost Entries by work package][]

+ Response 403 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the client does not have sufficient permissions.

    **Required permission:** view cost entries **or** view own cost entries (on work package's project)

    *Note that you will only receive this error, if you are at least allowed to see the corresponding work package.*

    + Body

            {

            }

+ Response 404 (application/hal+json)

    Returned if the work package does not exist or the client does not have sufficient permissions
    to see it.

    **Required permission:** view work package

    *Note: A client without sufficient permissions shall not be able to test for the existence of a work package.
    That's why a 404 is returned here, even if a 403 might be more appropriate.*

## Work package costs per type [/api/v3/work_packages/{id}/summarized_costs_by_type]

Returns a list of `AggregatedCostEntry`, with one entry per spent cost type.
The spent units of all cost entries visible to the current user are summed up for each entry.

An `AggregatedCostEntry` is a stripped down variant of a normal `CostEntry` which only has the link to
a `CostType` and the amount of `spentUnits`.

*Note that this is a preliminary endpoint. It is subject to future changes or removal.*

The following properties are only added to work packages in projects where the costs module is activated.
If the costs module is not available on a given work package, there will be no additional properties.

he is allowed to see his own time entries in projects where the costs module is enabled.
