# Purpose: This is a "concern" to check if a user is authorized to
# Manage Storages and guard against unauthorized users.
# It acts as a factored-out add-on to a model, that's why there is
# model specific functions in the "included" callback.
# Reference: Here is a tutorial about concerns. They basically inject
# the content of the "included do ... end" block into their target.

      # extend is like include, but imports methods as class (not instance) methods.

      # "included" is a callback that is invoked whenever this Concern is
      # included in another module or class, injecting the contents of the do-end block
