# Purpose: When returning a collection of file links, our standard index endpoint needs a query class to have a
# reference to the embedded model.

# The namespace is programmatically derived from the model name. See app/services/params_to_query_service.rb:130
class Queries::Storages::FileLinks::FileLinkQuery < Queries::BaseQuery
  class << self
    # We need to overwrite the model method, as the standard implementation cannot derive the name from nested
    # namespaces. See app/models/queries/base_query.rb:31
    def model
      @model ||= ::Storages::FileLink
    end
  end
