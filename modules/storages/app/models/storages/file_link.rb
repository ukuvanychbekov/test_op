# A FileLink represents a single file stored in some Storage
# (currently basically a Nextcloud store). Additional attributes
# and constraints are defined in db/migrate/20220113144759_create_file_links.rb
# FileLinks are attached to a "container", which currently has to
# be a WorkPackage.
#
# Purpose: The code below is a standard Ruby model:
# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html
# It defines defines checks and permissions on the Ruby level.
# Additional attributes and constraints are defined in
# db/migrate/20220113144759_create_file_links.rb migration.
class Storages::FileLink < ApplicationRecord
  # Every FileLink references its Storage. A "on delete cascade" is defined in
  # the migration, so this FileLink will be deleted when deleting the Storage.
  belongs_to :storage

  # The object who created the FileLink should be of type User.
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: 'User'

  # FileLinks are attached to a container (currently a WorkPackage)
  # Wieland: This needs to become more flexible in the future

  # Currently only WorkPackages are supported as containers for FileLinks
  # For some reason this case is not handled in the belongs_to above.
