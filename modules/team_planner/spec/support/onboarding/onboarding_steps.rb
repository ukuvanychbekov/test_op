    # The team planner (and in fact every PartitionedQuerySpacePageComponent page) suffers from not being shown upon
    # clicking on an item in the menu unless the mouse is moved (or some other user event). Angular's change detection
    # apparently does not fire on the initialization. This only happens when moving from one Angular page to the next
    # without a reload. This is the case here, as the board page is displayed before.
    # So this is an ugly workaround when actually the page initalization should be fixed. But as this is an edge case
    # this shortcut is chosen.
