title: Focus state

Focus state in OpenProject is represented by a 2-pixel outline with colour _Indication/Focus_  around the focused element.

**Note**: _Active_ is a similar state as focused, but not entirely the same. For example, in the date picker, the start date can be "active" (meaning that clicking on a date in the mini-calendar will change the start date) but not in focus (because the mouse pointer has clicked outside of the field and the focus is technically outside the field).
