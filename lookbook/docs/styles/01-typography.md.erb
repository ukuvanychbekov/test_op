OpenProject uses the "[Lato Sans](https://github.com/latofonts/lato-source)" typeface created by Adam Twardoch, Botio Nikoltchev, and Łukasz Dziedzic (released with the [SIL Open Font license](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)).

There are 7 sizes, each with between three and eight variations.

## Considerations

A few things to keep in mind:

### Black text

“Black” text in OpenProject does not use the standard black HEX code (#000000); instead, black is defined as Grey-1 (#333333).

### Line height

The default line height is 16px, which corresponds to 1 REM with our Spacing baseline.

For each style, line height is specified with a slash. For example, for Header Small Bold, 24/32 represents 1.5 REM font size and 2 REM line height.

## Header Big

This is a larger header than the default, used in rare occasions where a header is needed for a containing element to a page. To be used only if absolutely necessary. Prefer "Header small" as much as possible.

So far, zero recorded use. Might get removed if this style is not used in until mid-2022.

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-header-big">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>



## Header Small

This is the default type used for page headers. "Bold" is default and is almost always preferred, unless there is a need to use regular to distinguish additional or supporting information.

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-header-small">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>



## Subheader Big

Very rarely used. Used if we need a header small than the regular header but still distinct from body text.

So far, zero recorded use. Might get removed if this style is not used in until mid-2022.

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-subheader-big">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-subheader-small">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>



## Subheader Extra Small

This is really an alias of _Body Small/Bold_ when this style is used as a header (in some modals) instead of body text. 

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-subheader-extra-small">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>



## Body Big

Used occasionally (where?)

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-body-big">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>

## Body Small

This is the default style for most text on OpenProject. This goes for labels but also input text. By far the most used style style in the application. 

The regular version is used, among other places, on:
- Button text
- Drop down select
- Text fields
- Table text
- Card: work package title
- Sidebar element

The bold version is used in:

- Table headers
- Calendar header
- Sidebar header

**Example**

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-body-small">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
</blockquote>

## Caption

The caption is used for indications and auxiliary information that usually adds context to a view, but are not primary elements. They are also used on elements where space is limited (like the date information on Team planner or Board cards).

The regular version is used, among other places, in:

- Chips
- Toast text
- Tooltips
- Card: project name and ID

The bold version is used in:

- Sidebar tabs

**Example**

<blockquote class="not-prose">
<p class="spot-caption">
  Aa
  <br/>
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  <br/>
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  <br/>
  0123456789 ! ? & / ( ) € $ £ ¥ ¢ = @ ; : , .
</p>
