    # **Single date picker**
    # ---------------------
    # The basic date picker is a key element in OpenProject and is displayed
    # any time the user has to input a date.
    #
    # Basic date pickers are attached to existing date input fields
    # and is displayed as a drop-down when that date input field is in focus.
    # It consists of only the mini-calendar component.
    #
    # The basic date picker can also be placed inside modals
    # like the work package date drop modal and the Baseline drop modal.
    # All date picker are built on the [Flatpickr javascript library](https://flatpickr.js.org/).
    #
    # On mobile devices, the component will automatically degrade to the device's native date picker.
    #
    # For more complex implementations involving date pickers (the work package date field or the baseline modal),
    # please refer to documentation concerning those specific features for notes on mobile-specific rendering.
    #
    # The library gives us certain functionality out of the box with a fairly high degree of customisation,
    # but also introduces limits (which will be mentioned below when relevant).
    #
    # Please read the [Flatpickr documentation](https://flatpickr.js.org/instance-methods-properties-elements/)
    # before using or contributing to date pickers.

    # **Range date picker**
    # ---------------------
    # Range datepicker allow inputing a range (2023-02-09 - 2023-02-14),
    # and shows the date picker with two months.
