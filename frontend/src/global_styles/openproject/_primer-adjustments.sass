// If an icon button triggers a dropdown or dialog, the focus moves to the dropdown/dialog.
// When we close the dropdown/dialog, the focus moves back to the button and it also triggers
// displaying the label tooltip. The tooltip also gets stuck open.
// The solution is to hide the tooltip if the focus was not triggered via a mouse click (:hover)
// or if it wasn't triggered by the keyboard (:focus-visible).
