# When included, it adds the ability to rebuild nested sets, thus fixing
# corrupted trees.
#
# AwesomeNestedSet has this functionality as well but it fixes the sets with
# running the callbacks defined in the model. This has two drawbacks:
#
# * It is prone to fail when a validation fails that has nothing to do with
# nested sets.
# * It is slow.
#
# The methods included are purely sql based. The code in here is partly copied
# over from awesome_nested_set's non sql methods.
