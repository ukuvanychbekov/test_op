    # Crowdin currently breaks some of our pluralized strings
    # in locales other than the english source.
    #
    # Strings are being downloaded with an empty string as value despite
    # showing up correctly in their UI.
    #
    # This results in the fallback not properly working as it's not checking
    # for empty strings.
    #
    # This patch removes empty string values from the loaded YML before they
    # are being processed by fallbacks. With it, english fallbacks can be used automatically.
