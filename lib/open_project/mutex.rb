    # Adds a mutex on database level via advisory locks:
    # https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/explicit-locking.html
    # employing the with_advisory_lock gem.
    # This leads to requests received in parallel by two different workers, which might be in different OS processes
    # on different hosts, to be executed sequentially.
    # The locks are, from an abstract perspective, on row level as the entry's id is taken to create the lock.
    # Other entries of the same class can still be created/updated.
    # Relying on explicit row level locking (e.g. ROW EXCLUSIVE FOR UPDATE) would not work, I believe, as it would still
    # allow reading. Allowing reading is desirable in some cases, e.g. when fetching for the work package list, but would not
    # prevent the creation of journals. The journals transaction could not be committed, but the faulty view of the entries
    # current state could be committed anyway afterwards. See below for details.
    #
    # We in particular have to wait until the transaction is complete.
    # Otherwise the following is e.g. possible:
    # Action 1 writes an attachment and releases the lock.
    # Action 2, running in parallel, writes an attachment and releases the lock.
    # Action 3 updates something, some time later.
    # Both have not yet committed their transaction so, given that we have the "READ COMMITTED" transaction level,
    # the two actions cannot yet see the attachment added by the respective other action.
    # Both actions now proceed to write their journals, which will create attachable journals based on the attachments
    # at that time. But given that both do not see the attachment added by the other action yet, they only add
    # attachable journals for the attachment added by themselves. To the user this will look as if one of the actions
    # deleted the other attachment. The next action, Action 3,  will then seem to have readded the attachment,
    # seemingly removed before.
