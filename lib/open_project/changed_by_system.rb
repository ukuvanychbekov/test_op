# OpenProject in its contracts has checks to govern which attributes are writable. Only attributes marked to be
# writable, can be set by a user.
# In some scenarios however, the system needs to set calculated attributes, e.g. if a default value is set - the current user
# becomes the author of the work package.
#
# While an attribute should not be marked as writable, is sometimes still needs to be changed, thus.
# Such attributes can be changed using this module.
#
# The flow would be
#
#   # The model is an AR class like work package
#   model.extend(OpenProject::ChangedBySystem)
#   model.change_by_system do
#     model.author = current_user
#   end
#
# The contract checking later on can then query for
#
#  model.changed_by_system
#
# This method will return the changes carried out inside a change_by_system block. It returns a hash of all the
# changed attributes as well as the value it was changed from and the value it was changed to.
#
# Querying
#
#   model.changed_by_user
#
# will return all attributes changed by the user instead.

    #
    # Attribute changes carried out within such a scope will not count to be changed
    # by the user. It can therefore be used to set calculated or default values.
    #
    # This should never be used with user provided values.
    #
    # No only the attribute is tracked but also the values. So it is safe to e.g. first
    # set a default value, and then mass assign attributes. If the default value is overwritten
    # by the mass assignment the change in value will give that away.
