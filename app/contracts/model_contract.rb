  # Runs all the specified validations and returns +true+ if no errors were
  # added otherwise +false+.
  # Validations on the model as well as on the contract are run.
  # Since the error object of this contract is the model's error object,
  # the errors of both contract and model are both added to it.
  # After validation, the errors can thus be accessed via both means:
  #
  #   model = SomeModel.new
  #   contract = SomeModels::SomeModelContract.new(model, some_user)
  #   contract.valid? # => false
  #
  #   contract.errors == model.errors # => true
  #
  # This of course is only true if that contract validates the model and
  # if the model has an errors object.
