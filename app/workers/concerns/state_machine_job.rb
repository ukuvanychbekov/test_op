# A StateMachineJob is a job that consists of multiple steps to complete where a step needs
# to be finished before the next step is to be taken. Between each step, an amount of time may have to pass.
# A job including this concern can define step-blocks that will be executed one after another.
# A step receives the return value of the previous step-block as input. In case a waiting time is specified
# the job will reschedule itself.
