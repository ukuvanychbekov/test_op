# Governs the workflow of how journals are passed through:
#
#   1) The notifications for any event (e.g. journal creation) is to be created
#      as fast as possible so that it becomes visible as an in app notification.
#      If the resource passed in is indeed a journal, it might get replaced
#      later on (by a subsequent journal). This will lead to notifications being
#      removed. In case the notification has a mentioned-reason, the mail is to
#      be sent right away. This accepts the possibility of the journal being
#      deleted later on.
#
#   2) After the journal aggregation time has passed, direct mails are
#      scheduled.
#
# This order has to be kept to ensure that the notifications are created before
# email sending is attempted.
#
# If it wasn't guaranteed, with the notifications created in one job and the
# mails send in another, the mail sending job might get executed without any
# notifications being created which would result in no emails being sent at all.
#
# An alternative would be to decouple notification creation and mail sending
# from another. But then, in app notifications being read could not prevent
# mails being sent out.
