  # Normalizes the different types of permission arguments into Permission objects.
  # Possible arguments
  #  - Symbol permission names (e.g. :view_work_packages)
  #  - Hash with :controller and :action (e.g. { controller: 'work_packages', action: 'show' })
  #
  # Exceptions
  #  - When there is no permission matching the +action+ parameter, either an empty array is returned
  #    or an +UnknownPermissionError+ is raised (depending on the +raise_on_unknown+ parameter).
  # .  Additionally a debugger message is logged.
  #    If the permission is disabled, it will not raise an error or log debug output.
