# Get the schedule order and information for work packages that have just been
# moved dates.
#
# The schedule order is given by calling +in_schedule_order+ with a block. The
# dependency object given as a block parameter contains helpful information for
# setting the work package start and due dates.
#
# About the terminology:
# * moved work packages have just been changed and rescheduled with moved dates.
# * moving work packages are impacted by the rescheduling of moved work package,
#   and will potentially be rescheduled and will be moving to other dates.
# * unmoving work packages are not impacted by the rescheduling of moved work
#   package, but are necessary to accurately determine the new start and due
#   dates of the moving work packages.
