# Deletes the roles granted to users by being part of a group.
# Will only delete the roles that are no longer granted so the group's membership needs to be deleted first.
# In case the user has roles independent of the group (not inherited) they are kept.
#
# This service is not specific to a certain group membership being removed. Rather, it will remove
# all MemberRole associations and in turn their Member associations if no matching inherited_from is found.
