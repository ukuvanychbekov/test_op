module BackupHelper
  ##
  # The idea here is to only allow users, who can confirm their password, to backup
  # OpenProject without delay. Users who can't (since they use Google etc.) have to wait
  # just to make sure no one else accessed the computer to trigger a backup.
  #
  #   A better long-term solution might be to introduce a PIN for sensitive operations
  #   in general. Think the PIN for Windows users or trading passwords in online trade platforms.
  #
  # Also we make sure that in case there is a password that it wasn't just set by a would-be attacker.
  #
  # If OpenProject has just been installed we don't check any of this since there's likely nothing
  # sensitive to backup yet and it would prevent a new admin from trying this feature.
