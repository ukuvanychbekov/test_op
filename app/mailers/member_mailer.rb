# Sends mails for updates to memberships. There can be three cases we have to cover:
# * user is added to a project
# * existing project membership is altered
# * global roles are altered
#
# There is no creation of a global membership as far as the user is concerned. Hence, all
# global cases can be covered by one method.
#
# The mailer does not fan out in case a group is provided. The individual members of a group
# need to be mailed to individually.
