# This class is used to wrap a Journable and provide access to its attributes at given timestamps.
# It is used to provide the old and new values of a journable in the journables's payload.
# https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/11783
#
# Usage:
#
#   # Wrap single work package
#   timestamps = [Timestamp.parse("2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"), Timestamp.parse("PT0S")]
#   work_package = WorkPackage.find(1)
#   work_package = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap(work_package, timestamps:)
#
#   # Wrap multiple work packages
#   timestamps = query.timestamps
#   work_packages = query.results.work_packages
#   work_packages = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap_multiple(work_packages, timestamps:)
#
#   # Access historic attributes at timestamps after wrapping
#   work_package = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap(work_package, timestamps:)
#   work_package.subject  # => "Subject at PT0S (current time)"
#   work_package.attributes_by_timestamp["2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"].subject  # => "Subject at 2022-01-01 (baseline time)"
#
#   # Check at which timestamps the work package matches query filters after wrapping
#   query.timestamps  # => [<Timestamp 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z>, <Timestamp PT0S>]
#   work_package = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap(work_package, query:)
#   work_package.matches_query_filters_at_timestamps  # => [<Timestamp 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z>]
#
#   # Include only changed attributes in payload
#   # i.e. only historic attributes that differ from the work_package's attributes
#   timestamps = [Timestamp.parse("2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"), Timestamp.parse("PT0S")]
#   work_package = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap(work_package, timestamps:, include_only_changed_attributes: true)
#   work_package.attributes_by_timestamp["2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"].subject  # => "Subject at 2022-01-01 (baseline time)"
#   work_package.attributes_by_timestamp["PT0S"].subject  # => nil
#   # Get only the changed attribute names at the timestamp
#   work_package.changed_at_timestamp("PT0S") #=> ['subject']
#
#   # Simplified interface for two timestamps
#   query.timestamps  # => [<Timestamp 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z>, <Timestamp PT0S>]
#   work_package = Journable::WithHistoricAttributes.wrap(work_package, query:)
#   work_package.baseline_timestamp  # => [<Timestamp 2022-01-01T00:00:00Z>]
#   work_package.current_timestamp  # => [<Timestamp PT0S>]
#   work_package.matches_query_filters_at_baseline_timestamp?
#   work_package.matches_query_filters_at_current_timestamp?
#   work_package.baseline_attributes.subject # => "Subject at 2022-01-01 (baseline time)"
#   work_package.subject  # => "Subject at PT0S (current time)"
#
# Visibility (permissions) of the work packages at the timestamps is checked with the following rules:
# * If the work package is visible currently, it is visible at all timestamps.
# * If the work package is not visible currently, visibility is checked at the individual timestamps.
# The reason for this discrepancy lies in the needs of the presentation layer. A client should be able to see
# the full history of a work package if it is currently visible.
