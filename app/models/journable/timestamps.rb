# In the context of the baseline-comparison feature, this module adds convenience methods
# to the `Journable` class in order to easy access to historic queries.
#
# Usage:
#
#     # Retrieve historic state of single work package
#     work_package = WorkPackage.find(1)
#     historic_work_package = work_package.at_timestamp(1.year.ago)
#     historic_work_package.id         # => 1  (same as work_package.id)
#     historic_work_package.historic?  # => true
#     historic_work_package.save       # raises `ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord`#
#
#     # Filter on historic data
#     WorkPackage.at_timestamp(1.year.ago).where(assigned_to_id: 1)
