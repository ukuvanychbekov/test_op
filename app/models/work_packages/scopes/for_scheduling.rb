      # Fetches all work packages that need to be evaluated for eventual
      # rescheduling after a related (i.e. follows/precedes and hierarchy) work
      # package is modified or created.
      #
      # The SQL relies on a recursive CTE which will fetch all work packages
      # that are connected to the rescheduled work packages via relations
      # (follows/precedes and/or hierarchy) either directly or transitively. It
      # will do so by increasing the relation path length one at a time and will
      # stop on that path if the work package evaluated to be added is either:
      #
      #   * itself scheduled manually
      #   * having all of it's children scheduled manually
      #
      # The children themselves are scheduled manually if all of their children
      # are scheduled manually which repeats itself down to the leaf work
      # packages. So another way of putting it, and that is how the sql
      # statement works, is that a work package is considered to be scheduled
      # manually if *all* of its descendants are scheduled manually.
      #
      # For example in case of the hierarchy:
      #   A and B <- hierarchy (C is parent of both A and B) - C <- hierarchy - D
      # * A and B are work packages
      # * C is parent of A and B
      # * D is parent of C
      #
      # * If A and B are both scheduled manually, then C is also scheduled
      #   manually and so is D.
      # * If only A is scheduled manually, then B, C and D are scheduled
      #   automatically.
      # * If only C is scheduled manually, then D is still scheduled
      #   automatically since A and B are scheduled automatically.
      #
      # The recursion will of course also stop if no more work packages can be
      # added.
      #
      # The work packages can either be connected via a follows relationship, a
      # hierarchy relationship or a combination of both.
      #
      # E.g. in a graph of
      #   A  <- follows - B <- hierarchy (C is parent of B) - C <- follows D
      # * B is a successor of A
      # * C is parent of B
      # * D is successor of C
      #
      # When considering A, D would also be subject to reschedule.
      #
      # At least for hierarchical relationships, we need to follow the
      # relationship in both directions.
      #
      # E.g. in a graph of
      #   A  <- follows - B - hierarchy (B is parent of C) -> C <- follows D
      # * B is successor of A
      # * B is parent of C
      # * D is successor of C
      #
      # When considering A, D would also be subject to reschedule.
      #
      # That possible switch in direction means that we cannot simply get all
      # possibly affected work packages by one SQL query which the DAG
      # implementation would have allowed us to do otherwise.
      #
      # Currently, we do not rely on DAG for increasing the path length at all.
      # We are still employing it in the check for whether all paths to the leaf
      # have a manually scheduled work package.
      #
      # A further improvement in performance might be reachable by also
      # employing DAG mechanisms to increase the path length.
      #
      # @param work_packages WorkPackage[] A set of work packages for which the
      #   set of related work packages that might be subject to reschedule is
      #   fetched.

      # The CTE starts from the provided work packages and returns for each of

      #   * id: the id of the work package
      #   * manually: the information that the starting work package is not

      # automatically scheduled does make no difference but we need this

      #   * the flag indicating whether the added work package is automatically
      #     or manually scheduled. This also includes whether *all* of the added
      #     work package's descendants are automatically or manually scheduled.
