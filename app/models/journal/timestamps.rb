#   Prefer `kind_of?` over `is_a?` because it reads well before vowel and consonant sounds.
#   E.g.: `relation.kind_of? ActiveRecord::Relation`

# In the context of the baseline-comparison feature, this module adds the `at_timestamp`
# scope to the `Journal` class.
#
# Usage:
#
#     work_package.journals.at_timestamp(1.year.ago)
#

    #
    # `at_timestamp(before_monday)` will return none
    # `at_timestamp(monday)` will return the Monday journals

    # `at_timestamp(thursday)` will return the Wednesday journals
    # `at_timestamp(friday)` will return the Friday journals

    # a journable at a given timestamp.
