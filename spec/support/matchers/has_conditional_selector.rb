# Extending Capybara to allow a flagged check for has_selector to avoid
# lots of if/else. Extension is available for both the `Capybara::Session`
# and `Capybara::Node::Matchers`, thus the matcher can be used on both on the
# `page` or any element (Capybara::Node::Element).
#   - expect(page).to have_conditional_selector(...)
#   - expect(input).to have_conditional_selector(...)
