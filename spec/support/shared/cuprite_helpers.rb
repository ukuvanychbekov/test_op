# Wrapper for Cuprite's `page.driver.wait_for_network_idle`
# Used to wait for Network traffic to become idle, helping
# in specs where AJAX requests are performed by angular components.
# This is especially helpful as it doesn't depend on DOM elements
# being present or gone. Instead the execution is halted until
# requested data is done being fetched.
def wait_for_network_idle(...)
  page.driver.wait_for_network_idle(...)
end

# Takes the above `wait_for_network_idle` a step further by waiting
# for the page to be reloaded after some triggering action.
def wait_for_reload
  page.driver.wait_for_reload
end

# Ferrum is yet support `fill_options` as a Hash
