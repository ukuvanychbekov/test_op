# Sets up aliases to examples/example groups in order to automatically
# pry into the state of the spec when an expectation fails or the example exits
# due to an exception and debug why it's happening without having to have to maneuver
# your way through the codebase and add a pry statement in a very specific location.
#
# This is akin to using `fit` to set `focus: true` on an example.
