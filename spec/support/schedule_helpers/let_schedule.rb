module ScheduleHelpers
  module LetSchedule
    # Declare work packages and relations from a visual chart representation.
    #
    # It uses +create_schedule+ internally and is useful to have direct access
    # to the created work packages.
    #
    # For instance:
    #
    #   let_schedule(<<~CHART)
    #     days       | MTWTFSS   |
    #     main       | XX        |
    #     follower   |   XXX     | follows main
    #     start_only |  [        |
    #     due_only   |    ]      |
    #   CHART
    #
    # is equivalent to:
    #
    #   let!(:schedule) do
    #     create_schedule(chart)
    #   end
    #   let(:main) do
    #     schedule.work_package(:main)
    #   end
    #   let(:follower) do
    #     schedule.work_package(:follower)
    #   end
    #   let(:start_only) do
    #     schedule.work_package(:start_only)
    #   end
    #   let(:due_only) do
    #     schedule.work_package(:due_only)
    #   end
    def let_schedule(chart_representation)
      # To be able to use `travel_to` in a before hook, the dates in the chart
      # must be lazy evaluated in a let statement.
      let!(:schedule) { create_schedule(chart_representation) }

      chart = Chart.for(chart_representation)
      chart.work_package_names.each do |name|
        let(name) { schedule.work_package(name) }
      end
    end
  end
